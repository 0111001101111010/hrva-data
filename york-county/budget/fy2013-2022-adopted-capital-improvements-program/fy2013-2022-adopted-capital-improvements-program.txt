Capital Improvements Program

FY2013 - FY2022





Introduction


The County’s Capital Improvements Program (CIP) is a ten-year plan which addresses both repair and replacement of existing infrastructure as well as the construction or acquisition of new facilities and equipment to accommodate current and future demands for service. A given capital project must have an estimated expected useful life that exceeds one year and have a cost of at least $30,000 to qualify for inclusion in the CIP.



The CIP is divided into four sections: General Fund, Internal Service Fund, Solid Waste Fund and Sewer Fund. The General Fund portion contains projects related to general governmental services in areas such as general administration, facilities maintenance, public safety, parks and recreation, social services, and stormwater projects. The Internal Service Fund reflects the projects in support of the County’s vehicle maintenance operations. The Solid Waste Fund reflects projects that support the County’s trash and recycling programs and the Sewer Fund projects support the County’s sewer system.



Financing of the CIP is provided on a pay-as-you-go basis or through debt issuance. Pay-as-you-go funding is provided from several sources including current tax revenues, interest earnings, revenues from other governmental agencies and user fees. Debt funding may include general obligation bonds, revenue bonds or lease financing.

Current Revenues



Funds used to support this area generally come from the County’s General Fund and are provided on a pay-as-you-go basis. Local revenues make up approximately ninety percent (90%) of the General Fund revenues and therefore are the primary revenue source used to fund these projects.

Highways and Other Transportation Improvements



This item is intended to support the transportation goals and strategies in the County of York Comprehensive Plan. A major portion of the available funds has been designated for improvements, which qualify for participation in the State’s Revenue Sharing Program. Each dollar pledged by the County is matched by the State and the County sets the priorities for the use of these funds.



Revenue Sharing funds have been approved by the Board for landscaping, signage, and other aesthetic improvements to the Route 17 corridor and other corridors are envisioned. A major portion of the program allocations is being used for roadside drainage improvements prioritized by the Board in accordance with recommendations from the Stormwater Management Advisory Committee. In addition, funds may be used for sidewalks, bikeways, and dirt street improvements. The unallocated balance to date is $1,206,522.

Enterprise Funds



Enterprise funds are established to account for the provision of specific services that are to be funded by those directly receiving the benefit. Examples of such services include solid waste and sewer operations. Fees charged to those receiving the services are generally established to recover the cost of maintenance and operations as well as long-term replacement of the infrastructure necessary to provide the service. Where there is some public purpose (such as health concerns or economic development) to be served, the governing body may designate a portion of General Fund revenues for transfer to a given enterprise fund. Most of the funding for these services is provided on a pay-as-you-go basis from bi-monthly user fees and connection fees. The Board of Supervisors has also designated 40% of the meals tax for the extension of sewer systems into areas where service is not available. In order to allow for efficient management and timely project construction, some projects may be funded through the issuance of revenue bonds. The debt service required for any bonds issued are paid from the applicable user fees.



The Department of Environmental & Development Services (EDS) is responsible for the operation, maintenance, design and construction of sewer systems throughout the County. These services are performed in compliance with local, state, and federal rules, regulations and standards, and in conformance with the approved Utilities Strategic Capital Plan. A brief explanation of the projects is included on the following pages. For more detail, please see the Board’s adopted Utilities Strategic Capital Plan, which is available for review at the EDS office, Libraries, and County Public Information Office.

Other Projects



 FY2013

o Kitchen Equipment includes kitchen equipment, ovens and steamers, and replacement of the food service information management system. Project moved from FY15 to FY13

due to the deteriorated condition of the existing equipment and is spread over FY13, FY14, and FY16.

o Grafton School Complex repair existing windows as they continue to leak badly when it rains. The windows will be removed, a seal installed around the window opening and the existing windows will be reinstalled. Project moved from FY20 to FY13 due to condition of existing windows. Project cost increased due to recent window replacement cost experience.

 FY2014

o Kitchen Equipment includes kitchen equipment, ovens and steamers, and replacement of the food service information management system. Project moved up due to deterioration and cost is spread over three years.

o Hot Water Systems at various schools to reengineer and upgrade systems in order to supply hot water to all sinks. Due to the energy crunch in the 1970’s and 1980’s, some of the schools were designed without hot water at sinks in some of the restrooms. With advances in engineering and new technology, it is now possible to provide hot water for the students and staff while still saving energy. Project is being split between FY14 and FY18 rather than all being done in FY20.

FY2016: Kitchen Equipment includes kitchen equipment, ovens and steamers, and replacement of the food service information management system. Project moved up due to deterioration and cost is spread over three years.

Capital Projects



 FY2013

o Seaford Elementary six classrooms. Trailers are providing sufficient capacity at the present time. Changed from four to six classrooms based on the number of existing trailers. Increase due to EPA regulations for storm water management which was not included in the original cost.

 FY2014

o Queens Lake Middle six classrooms to meet current enrollment needs. Increase due to EPA regulations for storm water management which was not included in the original cost.

o Bus Parking Tabb Middle. Project name and location changed from Bruton Area Parking to Tabb Middle Bus Parking and was moved from FY13 to FY14 due to the diminished parking capacity at Tabb Middle School with the parking of buses at this site. The requested funding for Bruton Area Parking Lot is insufficient given that land needs to be purchased for that project.



 FY2015

o Bruton High six classrooms to accommodate the projected growth created from new sub-divisions in this zone. Increase due to EPA regulations for storm water management which was not included in the original cost.

 FY2016: Waller Mill Elementary nine classrooms, gym, HVAC & abatement.

Notes: The School Division requested $15,951,000 in fiscal year 2015 for a new elementary school. The County Administrator recognizes the potential need for this facility, however, because the CIP must be fiscally constrained and the current model does not project enough funding to accommodate this request, the new school is not recommended in the Adopted Capital Improvement Plan.
