Capital Improvements Program

FY2014 - FY2023





Introduction


The County’s Capital Improvements Program (CIP) is a ten-year plan which addresses both repair and replacement of existing infrastructure as well as the construction or acquisition of new facilities and equipment to accommodate current and future demands for service. A given capital expenditure must have an estimated expected useful life that exceeds one year and have a cost of at least $30,000 to qualify for inclusion in the CIP.



The CIP is divided into five sections: General Fund, Internal Service Fund, Solid Waste Fund, Water Fund and Sewer Fund. The General Fund portion contains projects related to general governmental services in areas such as general administration, facilities maintenance, public safety, parks and recreation, social services, and stormwater projects. The Internal Service Fund reflects the projects in support of the County’s vehicle maintenance operations. The Solid Waste Fund reflects projects that support the County’s trash and recycling programs and the Water and Sewer Funds projects support the County’s water and sewer systems.



Financing of the CIP is provided on a pay-as-you-go basis or through debt issuance. Pay-as-you-go funding is provided from several sources including current tax revenues, interest earnings, revenues from other governmental agencies and user fees. Local revenues make up approximately ninety percent (90%) of the General Fund revenues and therefore are the primary revenue source used to fund the General Fund projects. There may also be grant opportunities for several of these projects. Debt funding may include general obligation bonds, revenue bonds or lease financing.

ENTERPRISE FUND CAPITAL PROJECTS



Enterprise funds are established to account for the provision of specific services that are to be funded by those directly receiving the benefit. Examples of such services include solid waste, water and sewer operations. Fees charged to those receiving the services are generally established to recover the cost of maintenance and operations as well as long-term replacement of the infrastructure necessary to provide the service. Where there is some public purpose (such as health concerns or economic development) to be served, the governing body may designate a portion of General Fund revenues for transfer to a given enterprise fund.



Most of the funding for these services is provided on a pay-as-you-go basis from bi-monthly user fees and connection fees. The Board of Supervisors has also designated a portion of the meals tax for the extension of water and sewer systems into areas where service is not available. In order to allow for efficient management and timely project construction, some projects may be funded through the issuance of revenue bonds. The debt service required for any bonds issued are paid from the applicable user fees.



The Department of Environmental & Development Services (EDS) is responsible for the operation, maintenance, design and construction of water and sewer systems throughout the County. These services are performed in compliance with local, state, and federal rules, regulations and standards, and in conformance with the approved Utilities Strategic Capital Plan. A brief explanation of the projects is included on the following pages. For more detail, please see the Board’s adopted Utilities Strategic Capital Plan, which is available for review at the EDS office, Libraries, and County Public Information Office.

Notes: The School Division requested $18,000,000 in fiscal year 2018 for a new elementary school. The County Administrator recognizes the potential need for this facility, however, because the CIP must be fiscally constrained and the current model does not project enough funding to accommodate this request, the new school is not recommended in the Adopted Capital Improvement Program.
