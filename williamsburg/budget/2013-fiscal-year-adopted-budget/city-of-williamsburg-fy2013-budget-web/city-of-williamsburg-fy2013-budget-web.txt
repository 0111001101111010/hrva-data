SUBJECT:

City Manager’s Budget Message



INTRODUCTION



With the past as prologue, the graph tells the story of a city government responding successfully to

the recession of 2008 by taking action to remain financially strong.





General Fund Operating History and Projections





The graph does not, however, demonstrate an equally important outcome: Williamsburg has



 Not noticeably curtailed the city services it provides to the public;

 Nor has it retreated from an ambitious strategic agenda per City Council’s Biennial Goals,

Initiatives and Outcomes (GIOs);

 Nor has it pulled back from measuring and reporting results through its Performance

Management System.





To the contrary, this budget document contains an up-to-date assessment of progress in

accomplishing the GIOs, and it reports performance information for each department and cost

center (see Section B).



Despite strong past performance, the General Fund Budget for fiscal year 2013 begins with three

big challenges to overcome in the form of additional burdens over the current year:





Added Cost



Percent Increase



 Contribution to W/JCC Schools





$415,000





5.7%



 Contribution to the Virginia Retirement System

$350,000



29.5%



 Escalation of Healthcare Insurance



$140,000



10.0%



Simultaneously, the 2013 budget has big challenges to overcome in the form of declining revenue:





Loss of Revenue

Percent Decline



 Decline in Real Estate Tax Receipts



$600,000





6.1%



 Decline in Sales Tax for Education



$ 85,000





9.8%



The net effect of these five challenges is approximately $1,590,000. The story of this budget is how

it tackles the problem using a combination of spending cuts and tax/fee increases. Spending cuts

continue the intensive efforts over the past few years to save money without noticeable reductions in

services to our citizens. This year, for the first time in twenty years since I have served as

Williamsburg’s City Manager, I find no acceptable alternative to recommending increasing the real

estate tax rate by three pennies, and the personal property tax rate by 50 cents. Further, there are

increases proposed in EMS fees and the cigarette tax.



Without any changes in tax/fee rates, estimated revenue next year will fall to approximately $31.3

million leaving a gap of nearly $1 million.



Looking at the overall picture for the year ahead, the Proposed General Fund Operating Budget

can be summarized by:



 Projected Revenues of $32,223,520, up by 1.3%.



 Planned Spending of $32,291,878, up by 1.0%.



 Reserves brought forward of $68,358 to fund in part appropriated contingencies.



 Recommended increases in property tax rates, cigarette tax rates and EMS fees.



 Full time equivalent authorized positions of 182.5, reduced from 202 in FY 2009.





A - 2





In the Utility Budget, $6,261,000 in operating revenues are projected, an 8.8% increase.

Recommended is a 6.0% Water and Sewer rate increase, from $4.30 to $4.55 per one thousand

gallons, beginning July 2012, per the Five Year Water and Sewer Rate Analysis. Comparing our

water and sewer rates regionally:

(Does not include HRSD)





In the General Fund Capital Improvement Program, a total of $6,065,950 is projected in new

capital spending, plus $892,946 in debt service payments, for a total of $6,958,896. (See Capital

Improvements Section E)



The combined total of the four funds – General Operating Fund, Utility Fund, Sales Tax/Capital

Fund and the Public Assistance Fund – amounts to $48,734,497.



With the above as an overview, the remainder of the Budget Message discusses issues particularly

helpful in understanding and reviewing the proposed budget, beginning with General Fund revenue

projections.



REVENUE PROJECTIONS



Next year (FY 2013) we forecast General Fund operating revenues of $32,223,520, a 1.3% increase

from the current year (FY 2012) budget amount. Looking at four broad categories:





Share of

(2.3%)





A - 3





In the Budget Guide (Section F) are detailed explanations of revenues, explaining the legal basis

and ten year trends of all revenue sources. The following is a summary of significant revenue

changes in next year’s budget under the four categories:



1.

Real Estate Taxes. Property tax projections are based on a total anticipated value of real

estate of $1.63 billion, a decrease from current land book values of 6.1% (5.0% residential,

7.9% commercial), reflecting a continuing declining real estate market. Backing up to the

high watermark, since 2009 property tax revenue will have fallen 14.2% through 2013.





Each additional one penny on the tax rate would generate an estimated $163,000. The

Proposed Budget recommends a three cent tax increase from $.54 to $.57 per hundred

dollars of assessed value. For a $200,000 house, this adds $60.00 to the tax bill. Very

importantly, the decline in assessed value on average of 5% results in a near identical tax

bill ($1080 @ 54 cents v. $1083 @ 57 cents).



2.

Personal Property Taxes. Better known as the “car tax,” the personal property tax rate is

currently $3.50 per 100 of value (offset by tax relief from the state). In order to close the

revenue gap in this year’s budget, I recommend an increase to $4.00 which matches the

rate in York and James City Counties. The increase will generate $325,000 in new revenue.

On a $20,000 vehicle, it will cost an extra $56 ($280 @ $3.50 v. $336 @ $4.00).

3.

Other Local Taxes. Other local sources of taxation include various consumer utility taxes



and franchise fees, business licenses, transient lodging and prepared food or "room and

meal" taxes. Taken together, other local taxes will generate $14,026,600, a 0.8% increase

from th

e current year budget amounts.





The es

timate for room and meal tax collections totals $3,400,000 for room tax, level with last

year’s estimate; and $6,150,000 for meal tax, a 4.2% increase, from last year’s adopted

budget. These estimates remain below 2008 levels. The room tax estimate does not

include the $2.00 destination marketing surcharge for additional tourism promotion, which is

a separate line item in the budget of $1.3 million.



Currently, the cigarette tax in the city is $.25 per pack. An increase to $.30 generating an

additional $30,000 in revenue is proposed.





A - 4





Taken together, all local sources of taxation, property and other local taxes, are expected to

generate $26,656,200, a 1.5% increase from the current year budget.





4.

User Fees, Charges, and Miscellaneous. This broad

category of locally generated revenue is expected to

generate $2,673,759, nearly level with the current year.

An increase in Emergency Medical Services transport

fees, bringing the scale of service charges closer to

rates covered by insurance providers, is recommended

for next year to help fill the revenue gap. This change

is projected to net an additional $100,000, or 23% in

revenue. No other changes in fees for licenses and

permits, nor for charges for service, are proposed in

the budget.





5.

Intergovernmental - Revenue from the Commonwealth. Revenues from the state

government in the amount of $2,893,561, which includes support for constitutional officers

and various categorical grants, are estimated to decrease by 2.3%, based on current

predictions of final state action on the FY 13 budget.





The estimate of Sales Tax for Education of $772,468, based on State Department of

Education calculations, is down by 9.8%, driving much of the decline in this category.





EXPENDITURE ISSUES



Next year we have proposed General Fund operating expenditures of $32,291,878, an increase of

1.0% from the current year adopted budget. Broken down in four large categories:

A - 5





Details on operating expenditures can be found under Budget Summaries (Section D). Highlights

of significant expenditure issues are divided between “City Operational Issues” and “Outside Agency

Issues.”





CITY OPERATIONAL ISSUES



1. Staffing. The total number of full time equivalent

(FTE) positions authorized in city departments decreased

from 202 in FY 09 to 183 in FY 12. The reduction has

been accomplished through transfer and reorganization

(including the 13 positions transferred to York County as

part of the E911 consolidation), job consolidations, and

reductions in force. Next year I recommend another

reduction of one revenue technician in the Finance

Department, and moving one employee in the Recreation

Department from temporary part-time to permanent part-

time status. These changes will result in an FTE of 182.5. Redoubt Park preserves & interprets two of the fourteen Civil War earthwork forts of the Battle of Williamsburg, May 5, 1862.



2. Salary Ranges and Pay. No funding for pay

increases has been included in the proposed budget. Except for the 2% average merit increase in

FY12, there have been no general pay increases since July 1, 2008.



3. Benefit Reductions. A number of employee benefit programs are recommended for elimination

or curtailment to reduce spending. The total savings will be approximately $93,000.



 Reduce the annual cap for the Dental

Reimbursement benefit from $2000 per family

per year to $1500.

 Reduce the Employee Education Assistance

program

by

dropping

eligible

tuition

reimbursement by 50%.

 Eliminate funding for employee Estate

Planning Assistance which now pays up to

$350 one time for the preparation of wills.

 Eliminate the Retiree Health Insurance

Supplement program which provides up to

$120 monthly to help retirees with their health

employment benefit actuarial reports.



4. Health Coverage. The city’s largely self-insured health care plan through Anthem has risen in

cost dramatically in recent years, continues to rise. Over a five year period from 2005 to 2011,



A - 6





employee health care plan costs rose 75%, from $990,611 to $1.74 million. The City now pays 82%,

and employees pay 18%, of the expense. For next year, Anthem’s preliminary estimate is for

another cost increase in the 10% to 12% range. The proposed budget includes an allowance for a

10% increase.



Therefore, the city should



 Obtain the final premium number from Anthem,

 Relook at a competitive alternative, specifically by getting another quote from the

Commonwealth of Virginia’s “Local Choice” program, and

 Reassess the city/employee share formulas to limit the city’s expense to no more than 10%

increase.





5. Virginia Retirement System. The contribution level set by

VRS for Williamsburg in fiscal 2013 will increase from 16.44%

to 21.29% of payroll as a result of the latest biennial actuarial

valuation. This increase will add $350,000 of expense to the

General Fund, and $58,000 to the Utility Fund. Group life

insurance rates at 1.3% of payroll will add approximately

$73,000 expense to the budget. These increased costs are

mostly the result of poor investment performance relative to

actuarial assumptions. The problem is common to nearly all

pension plans in recent years.

The City’s Public Works Department staff worked



throughout Hurricane Irene to clear street debris.





OUTSIDE AGENCY ISSUES



Nearly one-half of the city's General Fund budget goes to agencies and activities not under City

Council's direct operational control. Funding relationships are often complex, and vary in degrees of

funding discretion possible from year to year. The "Notes on Funding Relationship," contained in

the Budget Summaries and the Budget Guide (Sections D and F), help explain the city's role in

providing financial support to these agencies and activities.



Background documentation from outside agencies is provided in the Appendix of the Proposed

Budget, or provided under separate cover or electronically, as in the case of the School and the

Library budgets.



A number of issues concerning outside agency funding requests for the coming year need to be

highlighted:



1.

Schools. Based on 1) the Superintendent’s proposed budget, 2) current expectations of

State and Federal funding, and, 3) current expectations for renewal of the five-year Joint

School Agreement with James City County; we should expect a city contribution to the

schools in the amount of $7.741 million, 5.7% increase from the current year. The final



A - 7





amount will be determined by formula as set forth in the new five-year city/county Joint

School Agreement to be effective July 1, 2012.



The city’s school population has increased 88 students (from 828 to 916), while the county’s

has dropped (from 9,679 to 9,647). City children numbering 916 now account for 8.67% of

the children enrolled in the system. This dramatic rise in students relative to the County, and

the decline of state and federal dollars, will put a greater burden for school funding on city

taxpayers in FY13 and in the years to follow. I expect FY14 to be another challenging

budget to balance due to a projected large increase in school contributions.



2.

Library. The Williamsburg Regional Library is funded under the revised library agreement

with James City County, effective July 1, 2006. That agreement calls for funding of

operational costs based on the proportion of circulation by residency. Based on the library’s

figures, the city/county circulation ratio to be applied in FY 13 is 16.6% city, and 83.4%

county. The Library’s proposed budget of $5,822,178 is an increase of 0.3%, which will

result in a city contribution of $796,565.



3.

Regional Jail. Funding the city’s share of the Virginia Peninsula Regional Jail is expected

to be $1,262,414, nearly level with the current budget. State cuts in jail funding continue to

drive up local jail costs, but the city share of jail costs is based on the average usage rate

over the past five years. Each member jurisdiction (Williamsburg, James City County, York

and Poquoson) pays for their share of the inmate population, based on location where the



offense occurred and the arresting authority. We expect to pay 18% of local jail costs this

coming year.



4.

Health Services. The three agencies named below provide health services to city

residents, workers and visitors. The total recommended funding for FY 13 is $427,629:



The Peninsula Health District budget request to the city is $98,339, a 12.6% decrease from

the current year, based on a complex use-based formula.



The Human Services Advisory Board has recommended Olde Towne Medical Center

(Williamsburg Area Medical Assistance Corporation or WAMAC) receive funding of $83,430,

the same as the current year. The Comprehensive Health Investment Program (CHIP) is no

longer in operation. Part of the city support for this program has been transferred to Child

Development Resources (CDR) as noted below.



Finally, Colonial Behavioral Health, the

agency through which the city provides

mental health and retardation services to

its residents, requests an increase, but

level funding in city contribution of

$245,860 is recommended again this

year.





Graduates of the City’s 2011 Summer Youth Achievement Program.





A - 8





Human Service Agencies. The city's Human Services Advisory Board, as requested by

City Council, has evaluated Human Services Agency requests for funding, and made its

recommendations to City Council. Their analysis and recommendations are in the Appendix

to the Proposed Budget. Proposed for next year is $88,244, an increase of 8.62% primarily

the result of CDR funding.



5.

Community and Economic Development Agencies.



Tourism Promotion



The city has supported tourism advertising

and

promotion

through

Colonial

Williamsburg as our premier “destination

driver,” and the Greater Williamsburg

Chamber and Tourism Alliance as our

regional

“destination

marketing

organization.”



This year Colonial Williamsburg Foundation

has requested level funding of $1,300,000.

The City and Colonial Williamsburg have partnered with

The Greater Williamsburg Chamber and

the EDA to create Williamsburg Celebrates Arts Events.

Tourism Alliance, which in turn lends some

support to the advertising campaigns of the Williamsburg Area Destination and Marketing

Committee (WADMC), has requested an increase to $850,000. I am recommending level

funding for these two agencies. Despite our tremendous budget challenges, funding for

tourism promotion is necessary to grow the economic base for future city budgets.





The proposed budget also includes an

estimated $1,300,000 of pass through

funding from the $2.00 room surcharge to

the

Williamsburg

Area

Destination

Marketing Committee’s campaign. This

brings the total city tax dollars for tourism

promotion to $3,250,000.

Tribe Square, opened in fall 2011, is an example of College of

W

illiam & Mary investment in the City to provide additional student

housing and new retail and dining options near campus.





Economic and Community Development



In addition to tourism promotion, the city support is recommended for a number of other

agencies that make important economic development and community development

contributions to Williamsburg. These are listed in the Budget Summary section. No new

requests have been recommended for funding (except Child Development Resources as





A - 9





noted previously), and only a few minor changes from the current year (such as reinstating

the TNCC Discovery Center lease and no funding request from Crossroads).



6.

Cultural.



The

Williamsburg

Arts

Commission has again performed the task

of

receiving,

evaluating,

and

recommending funding for the arts. Their

report is copied in the Appendix to the

Proposed Budget. They recommend local

(Williamsburg, James City County, and

state challenge grant) arts funding of

$120,000. Of this amount, the city

contribution would be $55,000, level with

current year.





One of 7 new businesses that have opened since February 2011

in the newly created Arts District, accounting for 32 new jobs.



NEXT STEPS



The budget process now moves from the staff level, formation phase, to the Council and public

level, adoption phase.



The Budget Work Sessions, principally to look at outside agencies, are scheduled for Monday,

March 19 and Tuesday, March 20. The school budget will be reviewed at the Monday, April 9 City

Council work session. The formal budget hearing will be advertised for the April 12 City Council

meeting. Adoption is scheduled for the May 10 Council meeting.

CITY OF WILLIAMSBURG VISION



Williamsburg will become an evermore safe, beautiful, livable city

of historic and academic renown, served by a city government—

cohesively led, financially strong, always improving—in full partnership

with the people who live, work and visit here.





Clyde Haulman

To advance the city’s vision, every two years the Williamsburg City Council

Mayor

identifies new strategic objectives for city government. Biennial Goals,

Initiatives and Outcomes (GIOs) provide an expression of city priorities, as

specific and measurable as possible, covering a two year period. Longer term

objectives are expressed in terms of what the city hopes to accomplish in the

next two years toward that objective.



GIOs are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all city services and

activities. Instead, they provide a concrete, coordinated expression of City

Council's direction for change and focus in the near future. In that way, they

Paul Freiling

drive city government operating budget and capital budget formation. The

Vice Mayor

20011/2012 Biennial Goals, Initiatives and Outcomes, adopted in November

2010, guide budget decisions for two fiscal years, that is for FY 12 and FY

13.



Under ten Goal statements 78 specific Initiatives are identified. In addition to

the Initiatives, Outcomes from the National Citizen Survey (NCS), and

“Desired Outcomes” and Observed Results,” provide performance metrics

which help assess goal achievement. Williamsburg participated in the NCS in

Judith Knudson

May 2008 and 2010. Reported here are citizen ratings of “Good” or

Council Member

“Excellent” for 69 questions and whether those ratings were “above,”

“below,” or “similar” to the benchmark average of hundreds of other cities

and counties across the nation (cross referenced to the page in Williamsburg’s

NCS Report).



The Biennial GIOs are created in light of a variety of resources including the

city's Comprehensive Plan, Five Year Capital Improvement Program (CIP),

and Economic Development Strategic Plan; and with input from citizens, city

staff, and volunteers. Biennial goal statements directly align with the 2006

Scott Foster

Comprehensive Plan goals. Initiative statements with a  symbol directly

research and responses to community complaints and concerns.

Join the International Town & Gown Association (ITGA) with the College of William and Mary to

guide and encourage new town/gown initiatives.

City joined ITGA in December 2010. Deputy Planning Director, the NRC representative, attended

the annual conference in June 2011.



D. Stryker Center – City/Library Partnership 

Explore and advance the concept of a partnership between the City and the Williamsburg Regional

Library to replace the existing Stryker Building to meet the

city’s governmental needs, and to satisfy unmet demands for

civic and community activity space and expanded access to

digital and cultural services of the Library. This is the next

step in development of the “City Square” municipal center.

The Center could include such features as a City Council

chamber and conference room, voter registration, permanent

and changing exhibit/gallery, and reception space – all shared

with Library uses, such as, educational and arts programming, video production and origination,

film screening, and diverse community meeting and activities…A place where citizens interact

easily with government and one another.



The initial meeting was held with city and library staff with the architect/site planner for the

Municipal Center.

E. Communications Franchises

Negotiate a renewal of the telecommunication’s franchises with Verizon and Cox Communications

during the biennium.

Franchise with Cox Communications was renewed in May 2011. No progress has been made on

the Verizon Franchise.

F. Voter Rights Pre-Clearance

Submit an application to the U.S. Department of Justice and petition the Federal District Court to

allow Williamsburg to be exempted from the preclearance process for changing voting and polling

locations.

Pre-clearance exemption process is complete, the Order has been entered, and the City is now

exempt from these requirements.

G. City Council Meeting Time of Day

Move City Council Work Sessions from 4:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. on Mondays for a six month trial.

Evaluate in April 2011.

Completed. Based on attendance records during the trial period, City Council reverted Work

Session meeting times back to 4:00 p.m. beginning June 2011. Council agreed to continue to hold

special meetings at 7:00 p.m. on specific policy issues as needed.

GOAL II



PROTECT AND ENHANCE WILLIAMSBURG’S UNIQUE CHARACTER AS DEFINED

BY ITS ICONIC PLACES—THE COLONIAL WILLIAMSBURG HISTORIC AREA AND

CAMPUS OF THE COLLEGE OF WILLIAM AND MARY—AND AS REINFORCED BY

THE NATURAL AND MANMADE ENVIRONMENT OF ITS BEST ENTRANCE

CORRIDORS, OPEN SPACES, AND PEOPLE PLACES.

GOAL II INITIATIVES





A. Vision for Monticello/Lafayette/Richmond Road Area

Create a vision plan for the area centered around Williamsburg and Monticello

shopping centers, addressing future retail and residential improvements. This

should be part of the 2012 Williamsburg Comprehensive Plan update, and

coordinated with the arts district concept (see Goal III, arts district item).

The 2012 Comprehensive Plan will designate the “Midtown Planning Area”

which includes the Arts District. The Comprehensive Plan will analyze

existing conditions and recommend changes to zoning regulations, including

permitted uses and residential density. This is the City's most urban

commercial corridor with access to public transportation and adjacent to the

College of William and Mary. The 2012 Comprehensive Plan and the ArtsSpace Survey results

will recommend a vision for the area consistent with its location and potential.



B. Vision for Northeast Triangle of City

Appoint a focus group with representatives from city boards and commissions, citizens, business

owners and city staff to develop a vision for the northeast “triangle” of the City (Capitol Landing

Road - Merrimac Trail - Second Street), to be used as input for the 2012 Comprehensive Plan

update. The focus group needs to complete work by fall 2011.

The Northeast Triangle Focus Group was appointed in December 2010, and completed its work in

November 2011. Four public forums were held – on the entire focus area, on residential issues, on

commercial issues, and to present the final report. The final report was presented to City Council in

February 2012, and will be used as input for the 2012 Comprehensive Plan update and City

Council’s 2013/2014 Goals, Initiatives, and Outcomes.

C. Future Community in Southeast Quadrant 

Work with Riverside Healthcare Association to plan and

facilitate building high quality, sustainable new city

neighborhoods and commercial areas between Quarterpath Road

and Route 60 east, with Doctors Hospital of Williamsburg as an

anchor. Coordinate development processes with James City

County for a seamless new community of regional significance

and in keeping with Williamsburg’s unique character.

The Development Plan for Battery Boulevard utilities and

grading was approved by Planning Commission in May 2011.

The site plan for Doctors’ Hospital was approved in May 2011

and Riverside broke ground in July 2011. Riverside is updating

the Master Plan for the development. Discussion of this area



B - 7





was part of one of the first 2012 Comprehensive Plan Community Forum held in February 2012,

and will be combined with discussion of the Marquis area in York County, and the Busch area in

James City County. A follow up work session by the three Planning Commissions is scheduled for

April 2012.

D. Targeted Redevelopment Opportunities

Identify and prioritize redevelopment opportunities for individual underutilized properties, and

work with the owners to facilitate new or adaptive reuse projects.

Staff meets regularly to confer on all known redevelopment opportunities where owners are

actively engaged in redoing their properties. Several properties have been targeted and

implemented: Tribe Square is complete, work is almost complete on the Hermes Building next to

Paul's Deli, demolition is complete for Prince George Commons (Mama Mias redevelopment), a

site plan/special use permit has been approved for the Carlton Holdings mixed use development on

Second Street/Penniman Road (next to the Velvet Shoestring). All of these projects required

extensive collaboration between the owner/developer and city staff.

Evaluate regulations and guidelines to determine if revisions would encourage redevelopment in

targeted areas of the city.

This will be incorporated as a part of the 2012 Comprehensive Plan update, and will include the

Northeast Triangle Planning Area, the Midtown Planning Area, and the Downtown Planning Areas,

as well as examining other regulations on a City-wide basis.



E. Corridor Beautification 

Collaborate with James City and York Counties on efforts led by the Greater Williamsburg

Chamber and Tourism Alliance to enhance the Route 60 east corridor from Busch Gardens into the

city.



City Council has been briefed on the Rt. 60 corridor plan, and the project is partly funded in the

CIP. With JCC and York, the city has applied for a VDOT Enhancement Grant. City Landscape

Superintendent has been assigned as the City’s project representative and Carlton Abbott and

Partners is the consultant for the project. Colonial Williamsburg and Busch Gardens have pledged

support.

Improve the pedestrian environment on Richmond Road and Scotland/Prince George Streets from

the Deli area to Boundary Street in conjunction with redevelopment projects (Tribe Square, Mama

Mias, and Hermes next to Paul’s Deli).

Brick sidewalk has been installed along Richmond Road in front of Tribe Square, and a sidewalk

has been installed along Prince George Street behind Tribe Square. The remaining sidewalk

sections along Prince George Street from Boundary Street to approximately Braxton Court will be

done with the Prince George Street reconstruction project with proposed revenue sharing funds in

FY13.

Initiate the underground utility wires project on Page Street in fiscal 2012.

Preliminary discussions have been had with Dominion Power.

Work with CSX to remove litter from CSX right-of-way within the city and the Historic Triangle.

Most of right-of-way was cleaned last year. Discussions are in process with CSX to expedite

approval process for the city to gain legal access to the property in order to remove litter.

station.

Project completed – Fire station building was demolished and site restored in the fall 2011.

Replace existing raised median in 2011 at College Corner with granite curb median to better

withstand heavy trucks.

Project completed.



F. Open Space Preservation

Actively pursue acquisition of open space and land conservation, either through purchase of

ownership or development rights, both in the City and in Waller Mill Reservoir watershed,

whenever availability, price and budget capacity align.

Staff continues to stay abreast of potential property acquisitions in the watershed, no purchases to

date.

Implement the new Heritage Tree Program with periodic progress reports on the success of the

program during the biennium.

Completed. Program adopted and implemented in June 2010 with initial heritage trees named.

Committee considered several subsequent nominations but they did not qualify for inclusion in the

program.

G. Historic Building Survey

Update the City’s design review guidelines using information gathered from the historic building

survey, by 2012.

The update of the Historic Building Survey is underway and expected to be completed in FY13.

AND REDEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES.



GOAL III INITIATIVES





A. Economic Development Strategic Plan Update

Update the Economic Development Strategic Plan for the five

year period 2011-2016, including input from the Historic

Triangle Collaborative Economic Diversity Report, and

incorporate its recommendations into the 2012 Comprehensive

Plan.

The City’s EDA has completed its call for public input and is

analyzing nine issue areas for the updated plan. Analysis will

coincide with the Planning Commission’s Comprehensive Plan

economy work session in May 2012. Anticipate completing the

update by July 2012.



B. EDA Programs

Implement new or revise existing EDA programs, as needed, to encourage and facilitate

redevelopment. These programs may include a façade improvement program, rehabilitation loan

program, deal closing fund, and change-of-use loan program.

“Core Vitality Vision” has been discussed by a subcommittee of the EDA to focus attention on the

city’s historic core between the Historic Area and the College and will be included in the updated

Economic Development Plan. A spring William &Mary intern is analyzing best practices for a deal

closing fund and what capacity (financial and personnel) is required to launch one.

C. Economic Diversification Strategies

Analyze the City’s role in a regional business incubator.

The three Economic Development Directors and EDA Chairs have agreed conceptually to a plan.

Pending a written proposal from the James City County EDA.

Work with Riverside Healthcare Association to recruit compatible and regional professional service

businesses to Class A office space at “Quarterpath at Williamsburg,” offering a “hub” location for

eastern Virginia – Richmond to Hampton Roads.

Submitted the one million s.f. of future office space at Quarterpath at Williamsburg for an

economic development headquarters prospect who is looking at Virginia and ten other states for a

location. No localities in Virginia were successful with this proposal.

Additionally, the city is working with the Quarterpath at Williamsburg developer WVS Companies

and the Quarterpath CDA, for this purpose.





B - 12





D. Tourism Marketing

Invest wisely in tourism promotion in fiscal years 2012 and 2013 through the Colonial

Williamsburg Foundation, the Greater Williamsburg Chamber and Tourism Alliance, and the

Williamsburg Area Destination Marketing Committee, to increase visitation to Williamsburg.



Council approved $3.45 million in FY12 for tourism promotion through CWF, the Tourism

Alliance and WADMC, same as FY 11.



Support the designation of the Historic Triangle as a “World Heritage” site.



Colonial Williamsburg Foundation is leading this effort

and has submitted the first application to the U.S.

Department of Interior.



Engage with William and Mary’s Tourism Task Force to

attract and serve William and Mary related visitors to

increase overnight stays and spending in the city.

First phase of William and Mary Tourism report was released in June 2011. The task force will

continue to meet and will focus on developing and strengthening external tourism partnerships.

Promote arts, sports and other special events related tourism (see Goal VIII).

For the second year, Williamsburg Celebrates, a committee of the EDA, is organizing arts events

for the month of September to coordinate with the Chamber and Tourism Alliance marketing of

September as Arts Month in Williamsburg. For the second year, the EDA joined the EDAs of

James City and York to fund a contract position to encourage and facilitate arts events in

September. The contractor is working with businesses and organizations of the three localities to

encourage them to hold arts events during September 2012.

The Chamber and Tourism Alliance Sports Committee is actively engaged in marketing our

destination, and the Williamsburg area is a serious contender for several large sporting events in

2012 and beyond.

Prepare for and host the 2012 Virginia Municipal League Conference.

VML has entered into a contract with Colonial Williamsburg to bring the conference to the

Williamsburg Lodge. The city has entered into a contract for “Host Locality Night” on September

24, 2012 at the Williamsburg Lodge. Plans are also underway for the November 2012

Transforming Local Government “Big Ideas” conference at the Woodlands.

Prepare for and host the 2011 Business Expansion and Retention International

Conference.



Completed.



E. Business Assistance and Recruitment



B - 13





Design and implement a business ambassador program where members of the City Council and

Economic Development Authority visit new and existing city businesses.

Since July 2011 through December 2011, 33 new businesses have obtained a business license in the

City. At the end of each month, an EDA member and a City Council are matched with each new

business for a welcome visit.

F. Business Recycling

Encourage business recycling through implementing the business sustainability challenge and

award program developed by the City’s Green Team by November 2010. Evaluate standards that

regulate outside recycling containers.



Green business challenge implemented in fall 2010. Seventeen city businesses were recognized for

their recycling and green efforts. A 2012 green business challenge is planned in the March/April

timeframe to coincide with Earth Day activities.

G. New Retail Guide Deployment

Analyze the economic impact of the Williamsburg Retail and Dining Map at the end of 2011, and

determine the return on investment for future printings.



The EDA continues to update and print the Williamsburg Shop and Dine Maps to encourage

visitors to patronize City businesses. In 2011, 15,000 maps were printed and distributed, with

8,200 of them distributed at the New Kent I-64 Visitor Center.

H. Arts and Creative Economy District

Move to the implementation phase of the arts

district report as directed by City Council in May

2010, and coordinate this with the 2012

Williamsburg Comprehensive Plan Update and with

the plans for the Vision of the Monticello

Avenue/Richmond Road Area (see Goal II, first

item). Implementation potentially includes adoption

of an arts district ordinance that offers incentives

and programs, identification of a viable cornerstone

project in the district, and the design and launching

of a marketing program to attract the “creative

economy” to the arts district.

City Council adopted an Arts District Ordinance at its February 2011 meeting. Six partners (Busch

Gardens, Chamber and Tourism Alliance, Chesapeake Bank, College of William and Mary,

Colonial Williamsburg, and the EDA) joined the City to fund Artspace’s Artists Survey to quantify

demand in the Arts District. Arts Task Force will review preliminary survey results in March 2012.

Since February 2011, five creative economy businesses have opened in the Arts District. Two

additional businesses have been approved and plan to open in March 2012.

I. Downtown Vibrancy

Develop a coherent vision for a vibrant downtown to include increased commercial and residential

uses that will result in more downtown activity (i.e. people living, working, visiting and shopping).



A subcommittee of the EDA is developing a Core Vitality Plan for downtown, which will be

included in the Economic Development Strategic Plan.

GOAL IV



PROTECT AND ENHANCE THE QUALITY OF THE CITY’S RESIDENTIAL

NEIGHBORHOODS, AND ENCOURAGE THE PROVISION OF AFFORDABLE

HOUSING FOR CITY RESIDENTS AND WORKERS.

GOAL IV INITIATIVES





A. Neighborhood Relations and Preservation near College

Continue the work of the new Neighborhood Relations

Committee during the biennium to improve the quality

of life in the neighborhoods surrounding William and

Mary by building and maintaining effective working

relationships between the city, college, students,

neighbors and landlords.

See update under City/College Relations (Item 1C.).

B. Merrimac Trail Neighborhoods

Focus city staff attention (Human Services, Codes Compliance, Police, Recreation, etc.) on

neighborhood stability and social conditions in the

Merrimac Trail apartment corridor, collaborating with

residents and property owners.



Public Safety continues to maintain a good working

relationship with all Merrimac Trail apartment

management. The Police Department is encouraging

more active participation in the three (3) existing

Neighborhood Watch programs on Merrimac Trail:

Barkley Square, Brandywine, and Priorslee. Efforts are

ongoing to increase participation in other complexes.



This area is part of the Northeast Triangle Focus Area study, which was completed in November

2011. A proposal to include the Village of Woodshire in the City’s Rental Inspection Program was

deferred until April 2012 to allow the owners to make improvements to the property.

C. Blayton Elderly Housing Expansion 

Complete the planning and funding process for expanded elderly and disabled housing on Blayton

Building property, with Williamsburg Redevelopment and Housing Authority, and obtain project

approvals by the end of the biennium.

The City and WRHA were notified in fall 2011 that the project was not awarded a HUD 202 grant.

The City and WRHA will continue to look for options to fund this needed project.





B - 19





D. Incentives for Workforce Housing

Determine, as a part of the 2012 Comprehensive Plan

update, the use of zoning incentives to increase the supply

of new workforce housing in Williamsburg, particularly in

the areas of prospective development such as the southeast

quadrant of the City.

This is being considered as a part of the 2012

Comprehensive Plan Update process. A Planning

Commission work session on Neighborhoods and Housing

is scheduled for July 25.



E. Residential Electrical Reliability

Obtain remaining easements for the Indian Springs Road

electrical reliability project where Dominion is willing to improve electric service reliability by

placing overhead wires underground.

Project will not proceed at this time as Verizon will not remove their facilities on a no-cost basis as

Dominion Power has proposed. The easement issues have been largely resolved.

F. City/Housing Authority Partnership

Increase partnership between the city and Williamsburg Housing Authority (WRHA) coinciding

with the co-location of WRHA administrative offices in the expanded Municipal Building for better

project coordination and operational cost savings.

WRHA moved into the Municipal Building in August 2011, and have been successfully integrated

onto the City’s data network and telephone system. City staff continues to work with WRHA to

implement a plan for additional conolidated services to be implemented within the next year.

PARTNERSHIP– COMMUNICATING, PLANNING, IMPLEMENTING, GOVERNING –

TO FULFILL WILLIAMSBUR

G’S VISION FOR THE FUTURE.

A. Ironbound Road Widening 

Advance during the biennium the widening and improvement, including underground wiring, of

Ironbound Road from Richmond Road to the Longhill Connector, as the City’s next major road

widening project scheduled for construction in 2016. Cooperate with VDOT and James City

County in the widening of Ironbound Road from the Eastern State Hospital entrance to Monticello

Avenue, also to include underground wiring adjoining the property of city residents, for completion

in the biennium.

Ironbound Road in JCC is under construction and overhead wiring is removed. Staff has had

discussion with VDOT to promote the Ironbound Road project (Richmond Road to Longhill

Connector) as the City’s number one VDOT Urban project. Funds are being transferred from the 3

traffic signal projects to Ironbound Road to assist in moving the project ahead. It will take several

more years to accumulate sufficient VDOT funds assigned to this project for it to proceed to

construction.

B. Quarterpath at Williamsburg Improvements 

Work with Riverside Healthcare to advance the completion of Battery Boulevard between

Quarterpath Road and Route 60 East with the Development Plan for Battery Boulevard approved

by Planning Commission in fiscal 2011.



Planning Commission approved the Development Plan for public utilities and grading in the Battery

Boulevard right-of-way in May 2011 – construction has begun. The Quarterpath Community

Development Authority issued bonds to build Battery Boulevard at a cost of $13.5 million.

C. Traffic Safety Enhancements 

Install traffic signals at Richmond Road/Waltz Farm

Drive, York Street/Quarterpath Road, and Second

Street/Parkway Drive, if and when traffic signal

“warrants” (VDOT criteria) are satisfied.

Due to the economic slow down and anticipated

development not occurring, these signals are not

warranted. Monies have been reallocated from these

projects to the Ironbound Road project.

Work with neighborhoods to install traffic calming measures on residential streets.

Five “Watch for Children” and “Curve” signs have been installed in Skipwith Subdivision.

B - 24





D. Pedestrian Connection Improvements 

Construct sidewalks and other enhancements with particular emphasis on filling in gaps.



 Construct five sidewalk projects in the current Capital Improvement Plan (Richmond Rd,

Rte 199, S Boundary St., S. Henry St., and Nassau St.) before the end of 2011 using

Revenue Sharing money.

Project completed.



 Work with the College of William and Mary to coordinate the installation in 2011 of

enhanced crosswalks at Ukrops Way using in-roadway-lighting (IRWL) system.

Project completed.



 By the end of the biennium, fill in the remaining sidewalk gaps on two major streets:

Ironbound Road between Middle Street and Longhill Road (old Fire Station property), and

Richmond Road between Patriot Lane and Waltz Farm Drive (this also requires road, curb

and gutter and storm drainage improvements).

These projects are proposed for FY13 as part of a larger Revenue Sharing Project involving

several sidewalk installations and the Prince George Street reconstruction project

(Boundary St. to Armistead Ave.).



 Develop a concept plan for a pedestrian crossing of the CSX railroad near Quarterpath

Road.

This initiative was discussed with VDOT and CSX as part of the regional Rte. 60 East

enhancement project which will use VDOT Enhancement Grant funds, if approved. CSX is

not in favor of an at-grade pedestrian crossing as they are in the process of trying to

eliminate such crossings along their corridor.



E. Bike Friendly Community Designation

Apply for certification as a Bike Friendly Community

from the League of American Bicyclists in 2011, and

consider the following improvements:



 Install bicycle racks in key locations, such as:

public buildings, Prince George Parking Garage

and Parking Terrace, Prince George Street.

 Install additional signs, as needed, on City streets

designated as “shared use.”

 Encourage bicycle parking in site plan review.



The City’s bicycle plan will be updated as a part of the 2012 Comprehensive Plan update in

conjunction with James City County and York County. Updates to the Plan will be used as inputs

for the Bike Friendly Community designation. A Bike Friendly Community application will be

submitted by the July 2012 deadline. Funding for bicycle facility improvements is included in the

CIP for FY13 and FY14. Bicycle parking is routinely encouraged as part of the site plan review

process.

B - 25





F. Passenger Rail Enhancement

Support the work of the State (Department of Rail and Public Transportation), Virginians for High

Speed Rail, Amtrak, CSX Railroad, and others to add at least one additional train per day both

ways, and to improve on-time reliability to over 75%, by the end

of the biennium.

The VRPT’s emphasis on passenger rail service to Norfolk on

the 460 corridor, makes it unlikely the Peninsula will see a third

train or reliability improvements during this biennium.

G. Williamsburg Area Transport

Work with Williamsburg Area Transit Authority, James City

County and College to continue the Williamsburg Trolley

Service after the grant funding expires in 2013, and enhance the

service if funding allows.

WATA continues to work on developing a funding plan to continue Trolley service after federal

funding expires. Fare increases to help address future funding gaps were implemented in January

2012.

Support WATA’s efforts to implement a weekly/monthly pass

program for transit riders.

WATA implemented weekly and monthly fare pass program in

January 2012.

H. Vision for Transportation Center Expansion

Prepare a concept plan demonstrating how the Transportation

Center complex can be expanded north of the tracks on presently vacant property to provide

parking and access for more intercity rail service (Amtrak) and perhaps even future light rail

service.

A consulting architect has been engaged to assist in preparing the concept plan.

A. Storm Ready Community Re-Designation

Complete the National Oceanic and Atmospheric

Administration (NOAA) “Storm Ready Community” re-

certification process by the end of 2011.

The City met the necessary requirements to obtain the

Storm Ready Community designation for an additional

three year period beginning December 2011.

B. Quarterpath Quarterpath Emergency Shelter

Operations

Develop and implement new shelter management and

operational procedures to prepare staff to support

emergency shelter operations during major emergencies and natural disasters by summer 2011.

City staff are currently working to incorporate the lessons learned from Hurricane Irene into the

shelter management plan. The plan will be completed prior to the start of hurricane season in June

2012. The City took delivery of a Shelter Support Unit which consists of a trailer that contains

medical supplies and equipment to support the shelter operation. The Shelter Support Unit was

purchased with UASI grant funds through the Hampton Roads Metropolitan Medical Response

System.

C. Merrimac Trail Neighborhoods Community Policing

Increase Merrimac Trail community participation in

neighborhood watch programs to enhance and improve

police/community partnerships in an effort to reduce crime

and police calls for service in these neighborhoods (also see

Goal IV).

The Police Department is encouraging more active

participation in the three (3) existing Neighborhood Watch

programs on Merrimac Trail (Barkley Square, Brandywine,

Priorslee). Efforts are ongoing to increase participation on

Merrimac Trail in other complexes.

Foot and bicycle patrols will be added in spring 2012 to enhance community interaction along

Merrimac Trail.





B - 29





D. Public Safety Physical Fitness

Redesign the physical fitness programs for police and fire personnel to promote physical readiness

and overall physical and mental well being, and link fitness standards to individual performance

evaluations. (See Goal X)

In March 2011 WFD has transitioned to an occupational

physician to conduct annual physicals, who is also

experienced in physical requirements for public safety

personnel and is well versed in National Fire Protection

Association physical guidelines. He will be assisting the

department as we establish fitness standards.

WPD has adopted a new “Fitness Policy,” developed by

the WPD employees who attended the “Law Enforcement

Fitness Specialist” training course. The plan includes

physical agility testing, in partnership with an occupational

physician. An “Improvement Plan” for officers not

meeting minimum fitness levels is being developed and

will become part of the performance evaluation process. Testing will begin in May 2012.

E. Police Emergency Medical Response

Train six police officers in first responder medical training to reduce response time for basic

medical assistance during the biennium.

Ten additional officers have been trained bringing the total to 23 officers.

F. Fire Equipment Replacement

Purchase a replacement fire engine for RE-10 by January 2011, and a new ladder truck (T-10) by

January 2012.



A replacement fire engine was purchased in November 2010 and delivered in August 2011. RE-10

was sold to a volunteer fire department in Virginia. The new aerial platform, approved for

purchase by City Council in October 2011, is currently in production with an expected delivery date

of July 2012.

G. Fire Station Renovations

Complete fire station renovations to improve the functionality and appearance of office space and

living quarters.

Renovation of the dayroom, lounge, EMS office, workout room, apparatus floor, and station

mailroom is complete. Renovation of the Battalion Chief’s office was postponed due to staffing

shortages and financial constraints.

H. Emergency Operations Center

Install a full function weather station in the EOC to provide emergency managers with current,

accurate, and detailed weather information by June 2011.



The full function weather station installation was completed in February 2011.

enrichment for residents and tourism product.



The department continues to support sports

tournaments at City facilities and increased the total

number of tournaments offered from 17 to 20 in

FY11.

I. City Historic Items Curation

Appoint by the end of the biennium a city curation work group of citizen volunteers and city staff to

research and inventory city historical items.

No progress yet.



J. Poet Laureate Designation

Designate a “Williamsburg Poet Laureate” for multi-year terms to encourage poetry reading and

writing in the greater Williamsburg community.

The Poetry Society of Virginia has declined to participate by recommending candidates for mayoral

appointment. Unless a workable selection method is found, this idea will not come to fruition.



K. National Recreation and Parks Accreditation

Start the process for submission of the “Notice of Intent to Pursue Accreditation” to Commission

for Accreditation of Park and Recreation Agencies (CAPRA); strive to complete the process by the

end of the biennium.



The department has begun the self-assessment process which involves meeting the mandatory

fundamental standards. There are 36 fundamental standards of desirable practice set forth by

experienced professionals, of which the department has successfully completed 20.

L. Williamsburg Visual Arts Center

Execute an option to lease with This Century Art Gallery to build a regional visual arts center at

Papermill Creek during the biennium, if This Century Gallery is successful in its capital campaign

for the project.

This Century Gallery continues to develop its capital campaign for this project, and to explore

alternative concepts. The Gallery has opened an art education center on Westover Avenue in the

Arts District.

GOAL X



CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CITY

GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATION FOR GREATER FISCAL STRENGTH

AND EFFECTIVENESS IN OUTCOMES.



GOAL X INITIATIVES





A. Budget Reset - The New Normal

Make revenue choices and spending priorities in

the Fiscal Year 2012 and 2013 city operating

budgets which will be financially sustainable and

fiscally sound in the post-recessionary

environment, while still accomplishing the city’s

ambitious goals, and reflecting the priorities of

the community. End fiscal years 2011 and 2012

with an annual operating surplus in excess of $1

million.

The City’s General Fund operating budget for FY 2011 ended with a surplus of $2.3 million. This

resulted from a combination of increased receipts for personal property and tourism taxes, and

operational savings in the City departments.

The City’s FY 2012 operating budget was up 2.5% from the prior year, and balanced with a transfer

from reserves of $148K. The operating budget includes higher expenditures dealing with a 17%

increase in healthcare costs, while requiring more employee participation with healthcare

premiums. The budget includes a 2% employee compensation allowance for merit pay increases,

and was distributed based on employee performance and market conditions. One additional police

officer position was approved. Revenues and expenditures continue to be monitored closely by

staff, and reported to City Council each month. The estimated operating surplus for FY 2012 is in

the range of $250,000 to $500,000.



B. Leadership Philosophy of Full Engagement

Engender a workplace culture where all employees take

increasing ownership for the effectiveness of city

government and outcomes in the community. Hold a third

High Performance Organization week long class.

Emphasize a leadership philosophy of enabling and

energizing all city staff, led by the department head level

“Strategic Planning Team,” over the biennium.

Another HPO class was held in October 2011, which

included a senior level work session on leadership philosophy. Several leadership philosophy work

sessions have been held and a philosophy statement has been drafted. A senior leadership work

group is developing a training to share draft and receive input from city staff. Training scheduled

to take place spring 2012.





B - 47





C. Performance Measurement System Development

Expand the use of automated performance data “dashboards” throughout the city organization.

Communicate performance and outcome information, including continuously updated “live”

dashboards, to the citizenry and to City Council. Retain ICMA Center for Performance

Measurement “Certificate of Distinction.”



27% of all City employees, which includes all Department Heads, have been setup and trained in

the use of Dashboards. We now have 183 individual dashboard elements created across all City

departments and functional areas. Public dashboards debuted at the August 2011 City Council

meeting. The ICMA Center for Performance Measurement awarded the City its 3rd “Certificate of

Distinction” in September, 2011.



D. Geographic Information System Advances

Build the GIS database for the utility operations, using GIS

data to better analyze patterns of water consumption and

sanitary overflow. Convert the Zoning Maps to fully

integrate with GIS. Upgrade system to the latest version of

the software, and build up the public facing GIS website.



Stormwater Management data collection and edits are

approximately 50% complete. Work is done primarily in the

fall and winter after the leaves have fallen. Stormwater

portion of this initiative is anticipated to be finished in 2013. Sanitary sewer mapping is

approximately 90% complete, with an overall target completion date of fall 2012. Zoning maps in

GIS were submitted to Planning the end of May. GIS system upgraded to the latest version in July.

Website work is ongoing, with completion targeted during this fiscal year. GIS system upgraded to

the latest version in July. Website work is nearing completion, with an anticipated live date of

April 2012.



E. Employee Wellness and Medical Cost Containment

Develop and implement a coordinated, city wide wellness program by June 2011, to encourage

health and wellness of employees and their dependents. Employ both education and health

insurance related incentives for the program, including the areas of nutrition, physical fitness, and

lifestyles choices.

City Health & Wellness Program implemented in January 2012. Program focuses on 3 areas:

education, walking, and information and awareness. Four educational seminars have been held and

63 employees have signed up for the walking club as of March 2012.

INTRODUCTION





THE CITY’S VISION



Williamsburg will become an evermore safe, beautiful, livable city of historic and

academic renown, served by a city government--cohesively led, financially strong,

always improving--in full partnership with the people who live, work and visit here.



DEPARTMENTAL BUDGET SUMMARY AND PERFORMANCE METRICS



The preceding section on Biennial Goals and Initiatives links the City Council ten broad goals to

specific accomplishments of 78 initiatives and to the Capital Improvement Program. Further, the

preceding section identifies desired community outcomes and observed results which relate to

each goal.



This next section aligns budget and performance data to the operating departments of the city.

For each department a summary page includes the department mission and expenditures and

staffing, covering four years. Importantly, desired community outcomes related to each

department, and observed results, are shown. Many of these measures parallel the measures

arrayed under the ten goals in the preceding section, including the use of the National Citizen

Survey™ results.



Finally, under each department are the budgetary Cost Centers which comprise that

department. Detailed here is information on four years of expenditures and staffing, and

performance trends, projections, and targets. Performance metrics – including workload

measures, efficiency measures and other useful indicators of performance – are shown with

operating data for the last two fiscal years, the projected number for the current year, and the

target or expected number for next year.

GOVERNMENTAL FUNDS REVENUE / EXPENDITURE TRENDS - 1982-2011



A trend analysis of the City's governmental funds operations shows how cycles of saving and spending

have balanced over time to maintain adequate cash reserves:



1982-89

Although revenues kept rising 5% per year, the use of accumulated reserves were

necessary to fund completion of major road repairs, a new municipal building, and a

long list of other projects city-wide between 1988 and 1989.



1990-92

These years brought an overall revenue growth rate of 5.9%, while experiencing a cut

in spending averaging 4% for the three-year period. This was again brought on by

deferring capital projects. This period also brought about increases in fund balances

totaling $2.46 million.



1993-94

Capital projects completed in 1993 brought overall spending to $18 million, an 18%

increase over 1992. Because spending was held in check while revenues were

increasing in prior years, accumulated reserves were available to finance these

projects.



1995-96

Conservative spending combined with a strong local tourist economy provided the City

with total fund balances in excess of $17 million at June 30, 1996. These reserves

enabled completion of necessary capital projects during the following few fiscal years.



1997-98

In an effort to maintain prudent reserve levels, $8 million in bank qualified borrowing

was used to fund the renovation of Matthew Whaley School and the Library. In

addition construction began on the Municipal Center Plaza, joint Courthouse, and the

water treatment plant. Capital spending and commitments totaled $22.26 million for

these projects with completion in June, 1999. Total general fund expenditures

outpaced revenues by $6.2 million during this two-year period.



1999-2000

The City Square Green and Plaza and the joint Courthouse were completed. Total

capital spending was $14.2 million over this two year period, ending with reserves of

$14.9 million.



2001 The Quarterpath Rec. Center expansion was well underway. Stormwater, street

construction projects, and other public works improvements were completed. General

Fund reserves increased to $17.3 Million. Utility Fund working capital also increased

by $1 Million to $4.8 Million, largely again with the delay of capital projects.



2002

The Quarterpath Recreation Center expansion was completed, the Prince George

Parking Garage (PGPG) was approved and site work began, and the Williamsburg

Transportation Center was renovated. General Fund reserves increased by $8.6

Million, largely by borrowing $7.5 Million to finance the parking garage.



2003 Underground

wiring for the Richmond Road improvement project, property acquisitions

for the City’s economic development plans, and continued construction of the parking

garage were the major capital projects for FY 2003. General Fund reserves decreased

overall by $3.5 Million, to $22.4 Million during the year.

GOVERNMENTAL FUNDS REVENUE / EXPENDITURE TRENDS - 1982-2011



2003 Underground

wiring for the Richmond Road improvement project, property acquisitions

for the City’s economic development plans, and continued construction of the parking

garage were the major capital projects for FY 2003. General Fund reserves decreased

overall by $3.5 Million, to $22.4 Million during the year.



2004

Parking garage was completed and operating in March, 2004. Prince George

streetscape project was nearing completion at fiscal year end. Additional property was

acquired for the Treyburn Drive extension. General Fund reserves decreased by $1.5

Million, to $20.9 Million during the year.



2005

Revenues exceeded spending in Fiscal Year 2005 as the preparation for expensive

capital projects – such as the Richmond Road reconstruction and the Treyburn Drive

extension – continued. Underground wiring continued along Monticello Avenue. Bonds

were issued for $8.5 Million to pay for the 3rd High School and refinance the Parking

Garage, and as a result, General Fund reserves increased by $9.7 Million to $30.6

Million.



2006

Capital projects totaling $4.4 Million were completed in FY 2006. Construction on

Richmond Road and Treyburn Drive was well underway at year end, underground

wiring was completed on Monticello Avenue, and construction began on Warhill High

and Matoaka Elementary Schools. General Fund reserves increased $1.9 Million to

$32.5 Million.



2007

Treyburn Drive, Richmond Road, and Redoubt Park projects were completed. Major

roof replacements were undertaken at the Police, Fire, and Library buildings. Warhill

High and Matoaka Elementary schools were almost completed. General Fund reserves

decreased from $32.5 Million to $30.2 Million.



2008

Capital spending in FY2008 included Quarterpath Road improvements, maintenance

on three city bridges, underground wiring projects, and the purchase of a former motel

property for economic development. General Fund reserves decreased from $30.2

Million to $29.0 Million.



2009

Major FY2009 projects included Kiwanis Park Ballfield improvements, the Emergency

Operations Center, and design phase of the renovation and expansion of the Municipal

Building. General Fund reserves decreased from $29.0 Million to $26.4 Million, well

beyond the City’s 35% reserve policy.



2010

Projects included emergency restoration work on Merrimac Trail to stabilize the

roadway at a cost of $.6 Million, $2.7 Million for work completed by June 2010 on the

Municipal Building renovation and addition, and school projects costs, including two

new schools, at a cost of $1.5 Million. Fund Balance decreased slightly from $26.4

Million to $26.0 Million, with a reserve ratio of 59.2% of revenues for the year.



2011

The Municipal building project was essentially completed, along with school projects,

and street resurfacing. Operating budget experienced a $2.3 Million surplus, and Fund

Balance remained at $26.5 Million, with the reserve ratio at 70.8%.

INTRODUCTION



This Guide is designed to assist those responsible for preparing the Annual Operating Budget and

the Five Year Capital Improvement Program of the City of Williamsburg. The budget process

defines, communicates, and funds the city's programs and priorities. The completed budget is City

Council's financial road map, and a primary management tool for the City Manager and Department

Heads. To that end, it must be a quality document, and our best efforts should be expended in its

preparation.



The Budget Guide is a formal call for all departments of the city, and agencies associated with the

city, to prepare and submit an estimate of the resources required for the next fiscal year. It includes

a set of procedures for building a comprehensive budget to be submitted to City Council in March

each year. It also serves as a mid-year review to identify adjustments necessary to the current year

budget.



AUTHORITY



The Charter and Code of Ordinances of the City of Williamsburg, and the Code of Virginia, prescribe

budgetary responsibility and process. Budgetary accounts are maintained according to the Uniform

Financial Reporting Manual for Virginia Counties and Municipalities, as prescribed by the Auditor of

Public Accounts, Commonwealth of Virginia. This guide consolidates pertinent budgetary

information as concisely as possible, providing a reference for making sound, informed, consistent

budget decisions.

INSTRUCTIONS

General



In early January, Finance staff will provide spreadsheets to departments with operating activity for

each departmental line item:



A.

Prior year’s expenditures for last two fiscal years.



B.

Current year budget.



C.

Current year expenditures through December 31st.



D.

A column for estimating current fiscal year total expenditures through June 30th.



E.

A column for next fiscal year’s line-item budget estimates.



Each department head should complete items D and E. The current year estimate is both the basis

for recommending amendments to the current year budget, and for determining next year's amount

for consideration by City Council.



Recommendations on personnel expenditures (addition/deletion of positions, etc.) should be

submitted in memo form. Payroll and fringe benefits line items on the printout should be left blank.

Finance will calculate and enter these line items.



Reminders for Preparers of Budget Requests



1.

Analyze each line item separately. Compare historical data, current year budget, and

estimated spending levels for the current year to assist with your request.



2.

Round all figures to the nearest $10.00 (i.e., $32 to $30 and $85 to $90).



3.

Verify all object codes, amounts, and totals.



4.

Meet all Budget Calendar deadline dates. Preparers should highlight key dates and actions.



5.

Keep backup materials used in computing your budget request. These will be used both in

explaining budget recommendations and administering the budget.



6.

This is your operating budget. You are responsible for closely monitoring expenditures and

encumbrances against the budget monthly. Written requests for Budget Account Transfers

or Supplemental Appropriations must be submitted on forms provided and approved prior to

obligating spending over the adopted budget.





F-4





CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM INSTRUCTIONS



Definition of a Capital Project



The Capital Improvements Program (CIP) identifies, schedules and budgets capital projects. A

capital project is a major expenditure which adds to the net assets of the City. Capital projects fall

within one or more of the following categories:



1.

Land acquisition or long-term lease.

2.

Construction of buildings, public facilities, and infrastructure, generally exceeding $20,000.

3.

Acquisition or improvement of property, generally exceeding $20,000.

4.

Major additions or rehabilitation to public facilities, generally exceeding $20,000.

5.

Major studies such as engineering, feasibility, etc., related to public facilities.

6.

Vehicles and equipment, generally exceeding $10,000.



Some examples of capital projects are: street construction, sewer lines, parks, sidewalks, storm

drains, water lines, building construction or major renovation, fire trucks, and police cars.



Engineering or planning studies, which are directly linked to a specific capital project, are part of the

cost of that project. Such engineering studies should be included in the project description of which

they are a part. Other studies and plans, which constitute a major expense of a non-recurring

nature, are included in the CIP even if they are not assets in the sense of a building.



Relation Between the Capital Budget and the Capital Improvement Program



The Five Year Capital Improvement Program is presented annually to the City Council. The first

year of the Capital Improvement Program is a capital budget and contains the list of projects for

implementation during the coming fiscal year. The CIP is updated annually as new needs become

known and as priorities change. It is possible that a project with low priority can remain in the CIP

program longer than five years as more important projects appear and move ahead of it.

Conversely, a project may be implemented sooner than originally planned due to changing priorities.



Project Review

All requests for capital projects and input on priorities will be evaluated by the City Manager and

Finance Director before being submitted to City Council.



The Planning Commission will receive the proposed Capital Improvements Program when it is

distributed to City Council. The Commission will be invited to advise Council on the consistency of

the CIP with the Comprehensive Plan of the City.



Capital Project Form

Capital Improvement Program projects will be submitted on forms provided by the City Manager.

The following is a non-inclusive list of project categories:





Streets and Traffic

Stormwater Management

Solid Waste Management

Park Development

Building Improvement

Water and Wastewater Improvements

Economic Development

Field Equipment

Parking Facilities

Planning/Feasibility Studies

Property Acquisition

Vehicles



F-5





Five Year Vehicle Replacement Plan

All vehicles owned by the city are listed on a replacement plan. The plan is based on a five-year

projection. It is updated annually with the rest of the CIP.



Annual Update

Each year departments submit an update to the CIP as the first step in budget formulation.

Updates include:



1.

Submission of the current year Capital Project Form with either:

a. pen and ink annotation to update the form for the next five year period, or

b. staple a revised form if changes are too many for pen and ink update.



2.

Submission of a statement for each current year project of work accomplished at the

six month point, and the accomplishments expected by the twelve month point.



3.

Submission of a revised Capital Improvement Summary for that portion of the CIP

assigned to the originator's department.



The second step requires department heads to a status report by July 31st each year of all projects

funded during the prior fiscal year ended June 30th. This information will be provided to the Finance

Department to determine the balance of capital projects funds needed to carry forward to the next

fiscal year for project completion.





F-6





BIENNIAL GOAL SETTING



The City of Williamsburg recognizes the importance of setting specific goals. Goals provide both

means of sorting out priorities, and a standard against which to measure effectiveness. More than

any other determinant, stated goals drive the budget. Goal setting is an integral part of the budget

process.



To advance the City’s vision, every two years the City Council identifies new strategic objectives for

city government. Biennial Goals, Initiatives, and Outcomes (GIO’s) provide an expression of city

priorities, as specific and measurable as possible, covering a two year period. GIO’s provide a

coordinated expression of City Council’s direction for change and focus in the near future.



Two or three new or incumbent council members are elected in May of even numbered years. The

newly elected Council members then have several months to become familiar with the workings of

city government before the Council attempts to chart the City's course. This is done through a

methodical goal setting process in the Fall of even numbered years. The City Council's adopted

goals then become a guide for the two succeeding budgets. In this way, a Council spends the first

six months after the election deciding what it wants to accomplish, and the remaining eighteen

months before the next election concentrating on implementing its goals.



During the midterm, or odd numbered years, the Council monitors progress towards achieving its

goals. A mid-biennium status report is prepared by staff, and includes desired outcomes and

observed results. But the formal goal setting process takes place only every two years.



In order to be fully useful, goals statements should have the following characteristics:

•

Goals should be as specific as possible.



•

Goals achievement should be measurable.



•

Goals should be short-range-one or two years. Longer range goals should be expressed in

terms of what intermediate goals or objectives must be undertaken now to achieve the

ultimate goal.



•

Goals should be developed by exception. The continuation of existing policies and practices

of city government should not be listed as goals, however important they may be. Only new

or altered policies or practices should be listed.



•

Goals should be followed by an implementation strategy provided in operating and capital

budgets.



•

The cost of achieving a goal should be counted in terms of time, money, and commitment,

realizing each goal actively pursued takes away resources that could be applied to other

activities.



•

Goals should be limited to those which city government has the power to achieve. While it

may be well to state goals which are primarily the responsibility of others, it should be

recognized that while the City has considerable influence, it does not have substantial

control over goals such as these.





F-7

BUDGETARY ACCOUNTS



Budgetary Accounts and Responsibility



The City of Williamsburg operates its budgetary system on a fund accounting basis.



The funds used by the City of Williamsburg are Governmental and Proprietary. The Governmental

Funds consist of the General Fund (01) and the Capital Improvement Program (Sales Tax 04).

These funds are combined in the City’s Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR), but for

budgeting purposes, are kept separate due to the operating and capital differences. The Proprietary

Fund is an Enterprise Fund (10) which accounts for the city water and wastewater as the Utility

Fund.



The General Fund is used to account for all financial resources except those required to be

accounted for in one of the other funds. The General Fund encompasses all city departments,

except utilities, and also includes entities funded through city government such as constitutional

officers, detention, schools, library, and outside agencies.



Capital Improvements Program is used to account for major capital outlay items. Historically, the city

has used the State’s 1% sales tax revenue to fund capital projects.



Enterprise Funds are used to account for operations that are financed and operated in a manner

similar to private business. The intent of these operations is that the cost of providing continued

services to the public be financed primarily from user charges and fees.



Expenditures of the City of Williamsburg are classified by fund, and within each fund by department.

Expenditures are classified by object (line item) within each department.



Departmental Codes and Responsibility, lists the individual responsible for submitting and managing

each departmental budget. In the case of outside agencies, Appendix A lists the city employee

responsible for overseeing agency funding.



Revenue Sources and Trends, documents all existing and potential sources of revenue received by

the City of Williamsburg to finance its operations each year. It contains a thorough description of

each revenue source, trends, and other pertinent information that should help the reader gain an

understanding of the basis of each of these sources.



Expenditure Classifications, provides an explanation of each line item to help in properly and

consistently classifying expenditures.

REVENUE SOURCES AND TRENDS



GENERAL PROPERTY TAXES



General Property Taxes account for approximately 40% of the City’s general fund operating

revenues. These taxes are derived from annual assessment of real estate and tangible personal

property located in the City. The City Assessor appraises real estate property annually. This

category includes property tax collections for current and delinquent years. Also included in this

category are collections for Public Service Corporations, property appraised by the State

Corporation Commission, and cover real, personal property, and machinery & tools. Revenues

received for property tax on mobile homes, boats, and motorcycles are also included in this revenue

category.



Real Property Taxes



By state law, all real property taxes must be assessed each year at 100% of fair market value. The

assessments are made on a fiscal year basis and must be complete and mailed to property owners

by June 30th for the next fiscal year. Taxes are then due on Dec 1, and June 1 of that fiscal year.

The current tax rate is $.54 per $100 of assessed value. The City’s real estate tax rate history is

shown in the following tabulation:

Personal Property Taxes

Tangible personal property is classified into two categories for valuation purposes, personal and

business property. Cars, trucks, boats, trailers, etc., comprise personal property, and furniture,

fixtures, and machinery account for business property. Property is assessed each January 1st, and

taxes are due on December 1st, of the same year. The rate of assessment for motor vehicles is

determined by the NADA or “Blue Book” average loan value. Furniture, machinery, etc., is assessed

at 30% of original cost. The City does not prorate for partial year occupancy. The tax rate is

$3.50/$100 of assessed value. Personal property taxes generated by select Virginia localities for the

fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 are as follows3:

OTHER LOCAL TAXES



This category of local revenues differs from general property taxes in that they are not billed by the

City [except in the case of business licenses]. They are dependent on business volume, and most

are self-imposed [businesses report sales activity directly to the City, and charges are based on

these reported figures]. Business activity is subject to verification by the Senior Tax Analyst.



Local Sales and Use Taxes



Local sales and use taxes are based on business activity in the City reported to the Commonwealth

of Virginia by all businesses that are required to charge State sales tax of 5%. The taxes are

collected and submitted to the Virginia Department of Taxation on a monthly basis and one percent

of these proceeds are then returned to the City directly from the State. As a matter of policy, the City

has designated these revenues to pay for its ongoing capital improvement program. Revenues

received from the Commonwealth of Virginia for sales taxes over the last ten fiscal years are as

Recordation Taxes



State law gives City Council the power to impose recordation taxes upon the first recordation of

each taxable instrument recorded in the City. Taxable instruments generally consist of deeds, deeds

of trust, and marriage licenses. The rate charged is $.15 on every $100 or fraction thereof of the

consideration of the deed or the actual value of the property conveyed, whichever is greater6. For

deed recordation in excess of $10 million value, a sliding scale is used. The Clerk of the Circuit

Court is responsible for collecting and remitting these fees monthly to the City. In addition to these

fees, a local tax is imposed (equal to up to 1/3 of the state recordation tax) and submitted to the City.

The City has charged this maximum fee for many years. A grantor’s tax is also collected by the Clerk

of the Circuit Court, and submitted to the State for quarterly distribution. This tax is classified under

the Non-Categorical Aid section of this report.

Fines and Forfeitures



This revenue category is used to account for court and parking fines. The Court system has

guidelines for setting case-related fines, while City Code sets the rates for parking fines. The Clerk

of the Circuit Court collects court fines and submits receipts to the City monthly, while parking fines

are paid directly to the Department of Finance. Effective January 1, 2004, the City implemented a

graduated parking fine structure. During a 60-day period, which begins with the first overtime

parking violation, fines will graduate as follows: 1st violation is $10.00, 2nd violation is $30.00 and the

3rd or more is $50.00. Revenue collections for fines and forfeitures over the last ten fiscal years are

as follows:

Charges for Services

The City uses this revenue classification to account for various revenue sources requiring charges.

Minor amounts are included under Sheriff’s fees and Commonwealth Attorney’s fees, of which the

City has no control over. Likewise, charges for correction & detention are for work release fees from



F-25





the Sheriff’s Department. Also included are charges for maintenance of highways, streets, and

sidewalks, which is used for billing special mowing or trash pickup and are minimal in amount. The

largest item under this category is Charges for Parks & Recreation. City Code authorizes the

Recreation Department to set and collect charges for programs and activities for use of its facilities

and services. Charges for Services collected over the past ten years are shown below:

REVENUE FROM THE COMMONWEALTH



Monies received from the Commonwealth of Virginia are classified as either Non-categorical or

Categorical aid. Non-categorical revenues are received quarterly according to State code, are not

billed or itemized by the City or any constitutional officer, and are not designated to be used for any

specific purpose. These are direct-deposited in the General Fund and used to pay for overall

operations. Categorical aid must be spent on specific purposes. In the case of constitutional officers,

expenditures are itemized and sent to the Commonwealth for reimbursement, based on various

formulas provided for by state code.



Non-categorical Aid



Items included in this classification, and a brief description of how City revenues are calculated are

shown below:

1. ABC Profits - Total net profits for ABC sales for the state are determined by the

Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control, and reported to the Department of

Accounts quarterly for distribution to localities. The funding formula for ABC profits is:

Locality population (based on latest census) ÷ total state population X net profits.





F-27





2. Wine Taxes - 40¢/ liter wine tax is charged on all wine sold in Virginia. Taxes are

remitted to the Department of Taxation, and 44% of the tax is re-distributed to

localities based on the share of each locality’s respective population.





3. Rolling Stock Taxes - The State Corporation Commission determines the assessed

value of “Certified Motor Vehicle Carriers” [primarily bus companies] and assesses a

property tax at the rate of $1 per $100 value. These revenues are distributed

quarterly to the localities based on the miles the vehicles travel throughout the

localities [based on reports submitted from the carriers].



4. Rental Car Taxes - Payments received from the Commonwealth are based on rental

car taxes collected by rental companies within each jurisdiction. A 4% rental car tax

is required to be assessed on all rental vehicles (prior to July, 1997 the tax applied

only to rented passenger cars). Rental companies submit the taxes monthly to DMV

with a report by locality. The Commonwealth distributes these funds quarterly to

localities.



5. Grantor’s Tax - The Clerk of the Circuit Court collects additional recording fees for

this purpose, details monthly activity, and deposits these receipts in a State Account.

Activity is separated at the courthouse for deeds relating to Williamsburg or James

City County. Funds are distributed quarterly by the Commonwealth, from a $10

million fund [$40 million per year] to localities based on their share of overall grantor

tax collections in the Commonwealth.



6. 599 Funds - Each locality in the Commonwealth is eligible to receive a percentage of

the total amount to be distributed equal to the percentage of the total adjusted crime

index attributable to each locality as determined by the Department of Criminal

Justice Services. The City must notify the Department prior to July 1 each year that

its law enforcement personnel have complied with minimum training standards as

provided for by State Code. These distributions are made quarterly.

Categorical Aid



The City’s Comprehensive Annual Financial Report classifies categorical aid into four sub-

categories:



1. Shared Expenses - Constitutional offices included as City departments/operations

with reimbursements provided (in-part) by the Commonwealth of Virginia.



2. Welfare - Pertaining to the City’s general fund, only minor amounts of

reimbursements are accounted for here. Virtually all of the City’s Human Services

programs are accounted for as a special revenue fund.



3. Education - The governor’s distribution of state sales tax monies dedicated to

education.



4. Other Categorical Aid - Largely the reimbursement for street/highway maintenance

monies.



Shared Expenses



1. Sheriff - This is a joint activity shared with James City County. The state refunds

approximately 100% of state-approved salaries and operating costs of this

department. However, since the City now is part of the Virginia Peninsula Regional

Jail Authority, the Sheriff now provides only courtroom security and prisoner transfer

activities. Jail staffing at the Courthouse has been significantly reduced, as many

former employees now work for the Authority. Salary supplements are not

reimbursed by the State.



2. Commissioner of the Revenue -State code provides for reimbursements to the City at

50% of salaries, fringe benefits and a minor portion of operating expenses. Any

constitutional officer can make special requests for payment from the Compensation

Board for additional consideration. For the City’s Comprehensive Annual Financial

Report dated June 30, 2010 total reimbursements were 43.5% of expenditures.



3. Treasurer - This is also a joint activity shared with James City County. The state

reimburses the City 2/3 of salary, fringe benefits, and operating costs for the Deputy

Treasurer, whose office is in the Municipal Building. The City, in turn, bills James City

County 25% of the non-reimbursed amount annually. In the City’s Comprehensive

Annual Financial Report, only the State reimbursed monies are classified as

Categorical Aid. Any reimbursements from James City County are classified as

“Miscellaneous” revenues, so an exact ratio of reimbursements to expenditures is

difficult to compute, based on the CAFR.



4. Medical Examiner - Reimbursed at $30 per examination.



5. Registrar/Electoral Board - Salaries are reimbursed by the State at 100% for the

Registrar and the Electoral Board members. No reimbursements are made for fringe

benefits or operating expenditures. The Department of Finance bills the State

Electoral Board annually. No salary supplements are made for the Registrar or board

members.

Welfare



In prior years the City accounted for miscellaneous general relief reimbursements through

the General Fund. This activity is accounted for as a special revenue fund, and is included in



F-29





the City’s Comprehensive Annual Financial Report in the Virginia Public Assistance Fund.



Education



State Sales Tax for Education -The Governor distributes 1% of statewide sales tax receipts

to every school district based on state census figures provided for school-age population.

This is adjusted with each triennial census performed by the joint school system and verified

by the localities.

Other Categorical Aid



Other aid received from the Commonwealth and designated for specific use includes:



1. Arts Commission - Grant funds are applied for by the City and James City County to the

Commonwealth for the Local Government Challenge Grant Program. Funds are received

directly by each locality. James City County reimburses the City for the State portion, and

also an additional amount each year as provided for during the annual budget process. Since

Fiscal Year 1998 each locality has received the $5,000 state maximum allowed under this

grant.

2. Street and Highway Maintenance - The City is reimbursed quarterly by the

Commonwealth according to lane miles of streets within its boundaries. For FY 2012

reimbursements for principal/minor arterial roads are $17,819 per lane mile, while

REVENUE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT



The City’s Comprehensive Annual Financial Report itemizes Federal receipts on the Schedule of

Federal Awards, according to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance catalog numbers. Human

Services programs account, by far, for the majority of the City’s federal funds. These programs are

accounted for in the Public Assistance Fund. For General Fund purposes, only limited sources of

federal funding exist. These programs are highlighted:



1. Community Development Block Grant - These are pass-thru funds for specific CDBG

projects in the City in partnership with the Williamsburg Redevelopment & Housing Authority.

The City received $25,000 during FY 2011, for a planning study.



2. Local Law Enforcement Block Grant - The City must apply for these funds each year through

the Department of Justice. An interest-bearing checking account is maintained for this grant,

and detailed quarterly reports must be filed until the funds are spent. The City received

$6,631 for the Byrne Justice Assistance Grant Program for FY 2011.



3. Department of Homeland Security - These funds are federal pass-thru grants administered

by the Commonwealth of Virginia. A grant for $17,000 for a license plate reader was

received during FY 2011. In addition, $20,471 was received for Citizen's Corp Project and

the Citizen Emergency Response Team training.

FUND STRUCTURE



The City's accounting system is organized on the basis of funds and groups of accounts, each of

which is considered to be a separate accounting entity. The operations of each fund are accounted

for by providing a separate set of self-balancing accounts which comprise its assets, liabilities, fund

equity, revenues and expenditures or expenses. The various funds are grouped in the financial

statements as follows:



Governmental Funds account for the expendable financial resources, other than those accounted

for in proprietary or fiduciary funds. The Governmental Fund measurement focus is upon

determination of financial position and changes in financial position, rather than upon net income

determination as would apply to a commercial enterprise. The individual Governmental Funds which

are budgeted are the General Fund, Sales Tax Fund, which are combined in the General Fund as

presented in the City’s Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) each year. The Public

Assistance Fund is also a governmental fund, and accounts for programs offered by the Human

Services Department.



General Fund - This fund accounts for all revenues and expenditures of the City which are

not accounted for in other funds. Revenues are derived from general property taxes, other local

taxes, licenses and permits, and revenues from other governmental units.



Sales Tax Fund (also referred to as General Capital Improvement Program) - This fund

accounts for scheduled major capital improvements for the upcoming year. Revenues are

traditionally derived from the 1% Sales Tax monies collected monthly at the State level, and interest

earnings.



Public Assistance Fund – This fund accounts for activities of the City’s Human Services

Department. The majority of funding is provided by the Federal and State government for social

service programs. The remainder of its funding is provided by the City as annual contribution from

the General Fund.



Proprietary Funds account for operations that are financed in a manner similar to private business

enterprises. The Proprietary Fund measurement focus is upon determination of net income, financial

position, and cash flows. Enterprise funds account for the financing of services to the general public

where all or most of the operating expenses involved are recovered in the form of charges to users

of such services. The Utility Fund, consisting of the operations for water and sewer services, is the

City's only Enterprise Fund.



Budgets and Budgetary Accounting



Formal budgetary integration is employed as a management control device during the year for the

General Fund, Sales Tax Fund, Utility Fund, and Public Assistance Fund. Annual operating budgets

are adopted by ordinances and resolutions passed by the City Council for those funds. Budgets are

prepared on the same basis of accounting used for financial reporting purposes. The City does not

integrate the use of encumbrance accounting in any of its funds. The original budgets and revisions,

if any, are authorized at the department level by City Council. The City Manager has the authority to

transfer funds within the departments, so long as the total appropriation for a department is not

adjusted. All appropriations for operating budgets lapse at year-end to the extent that they have

been fully expended. As capital projects can be multi-year, funds appropriated by City Council can

carry over to future years for projects not completed each year, at the discretion of the City Manager.

Basis of Accounting:



Governmental Funds:



Governmental Funds utilize the modified accrual basis of accounting under which revenues and

related assets are recorded when measurable and available to finance operations during the year.

Accordingly, real and personal property taxes are recorded as revenues and receivables when

billed, net of allowances for uncollectible amounts. Property taxes not collected within 45 days after

year-end are reflected as deferred revenues - uncollected property taxes. Sales and utility taxes,

which are collected by the State or utilities and subsequently remitted to the City, are recognized as

revenues and receivables upon collection by the State or utility, which is generally in the month

preceding receipt by the City. Licenses, permits, fines and rents are recorded as revenues when

received. Intergovernmental revenues, consisting primarily of federal, State and other grants for the

purpose of funding specific expenditures, are recognized when earned or at the time of the specific

expenditure. Expenditures are recorded as the related fund liabilities are incurred.



Proprietary Funds:



The accrual basis of accounting is used for the Utility Fund. Under the accrual method, revenues

are recognized in the accounting period in which they are earned, while expenses are recognized in

the accounting period in which the related liability is incurred.



Basis of Accounting vs. Basis of Budgeting



Budgets are prepared on the same basis of accounting used for financial reporting purposes

(GAAP). There are some instances whereas the generally accepted accounting principles used for

financial reporting purposes will differ from those used in budget preparation. Under GAAP

reporting requirements changes in the fair market value of the City’s investments are treated as

adjustments to revenue at fiscal year-end, and those effects are not considered (or known) in the

budget process. The other difference is the annual adjustment necessary to reflect the value of

earned but unused vacation leave due to employees at fiscal year-end. Such amount would be paid

upon an employee’s separation from the City, but is not known or budgeted due to the unknown

nature of employee’s use of vacation leave.

BUDGET POLICIES

A. Financial Planning Policies:



1. Balanced Budgets:

a. The general operating fund (General Fund) and the special local option sales tax

fund (General Capital Improvement Program, or CIP), Utility Fund operating fund,

and the Utility Fund CIP are subject to the annual budget process.

b. All operating and capital fund budgets must be balanced - total anticipated revenues

plus fund balances or reserves brought forward must equal total estimated

expenditures each year.

c. The Utility Fund (the City’s only Enterprise Fund type) will be self-supporting.

d. All budgets will be formulated and adopted on the basis of accounting consistent

with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).

e. The budget process will include coordinating development of the capital

improvement budget with development of the operating budget.



2. Long-Range Planning:

a. Budgets will be adopted annually, taking into consideration input from all

organizational levels of the City. The Planning Commission will review current and

future capital improvement projects and make recommendations to staff for input to

the annual budget document.

b. The long-term revenue, expenditure, and service implications of continuing or ending

existing programs or adding new programs, services, and debt will be considered

while formulating all budgets annually.

c. The City will assess the condition of all major capital assets, including buildings,

roads, bridges, water and sewer lines, vehicles, and equipment annually.

d. To estimate the City’s future financial position, the long-term impact of operating and

capital spending will be analyzed five years forward, concurrent with the formulation

of all budgets.

e. The General Fund will maintain a minimum of 35% of total operating revenues as its

unassigned fund balance.

f. Fund Balance of the General Fund shall be used only for emergencies, non-

recurring expenditures, or major capital purchases that cannot be accommodated

through current year savings.



B. Revenue Policies:



1. Revenue Diversification:

The City will strive to maintain a diversified and stable revenue system to protect the City

from short-run fluctuations in any one revenue source and ensure its ability to provide

ongoing services.

a. The City will identify all revenue and grant options available to the City each year.

b. All revenue collection rates, especially for real estate and personal property taxes,

will be reviewed annually, and all efforts to maximize receipt of revenues due will be

made by the Finance Department.



2. User Fees and Charges:

Fees will be reviewed and updated on an ongoing basis to ensure that they keep pace with

changes in the cost-of- living as well as changes in methods or levels of service delivery.

a. Rental of City properties – Charges will be reviewed annually and compared with

market rates for comparable space or property in the community. The City will



F-48





consider annual escalator clauses in multi-year rental contracts to take into effect the

impact of increases in the cost of living.

b. Building permit and inspection fees will be reviewed annually.

c. Recreation program charges will be reviewed annually. In general, all efforts will be

made to provide programs and activities at an affordable level for the residents of the

Williamsburg area while still recovering a major portion of incidental costs of

programs, not to include administrative costs or the use of facilities.

i. Charges for specialty classes such as yoga, aerobics, dance, dog

obedience, etc. will be set at a level to encourage maximum participation,

and also enable 75% to 80% of program receipts to be used to compensate

instructors.

ii. Team sports participation fees will also be set to encourage maximum

participation, with approximately 80% to 90% of charges being used to defray

costs of officiating, prizes and awards, scorekeepers, and team pictures.

iii. Admission fees for the use of the Quarterpath Pool are intended to provide

an affordable service to citizens. Fees are not intended to recover 100% of

the costs of operating this facility. The City encourages individual and family

seasonal membership passes at a minimum fee, which provide an even

more affordable opportunity for residents to enjoy this outdoor facility during

the summer months.

d. The City’s Utility Fund will be self-supporting. Water and sewer charges will be

reviewed annually and set at levels which fully cover the total direct and indirect

costs - including operations, capital outlay, and debt service.



3. Use of One-time or Limited-time Revenues:

a. To minimize disruptive effects on services due to non-recurrence of these sources,

the City will not use one-time revenues to fund operating expenditures.



C. Expenditure Policies:



1. Operating/Capital Expenditure Accountability:

a. The City will finance all current expenditures with current revenues. The City will not

short-term borrow to meet cash-flow needs.

b. Future operating costs associated with new capital improvements will be projected

and included in operating budgets.

c. Capital improvement program budgets will provide for adequate maintenance of

capital equipment and facilities and for their orderly replacement.

d. The budgets for all funds shall be controlled at the department level. Expenditures

may not exceed total appropriations for any department without approval from the

City Manager.

e. All operating fund appropriations will lapse at fiscal year-end. Any encumbered

appropriations at year-end may be re-appropriated by City Council in the subsequent

year. Multi-year capital improvement projects may be carried-forward in the

subsequent year, at the discretion of the City Manager.

f. The City will include contingency line items in the General Fund, General CIP, and

Utility Fund CIP, not to exceed $200,000, to be administered by the City Manager, to

meet unanticipated expenditures of a non-recurring nature.

g. The City will maintain a budgetary control system to ensure adherence to the budget

and will prepare and present to City Council monthly financial reports comparing

actual revenues and expenditures with budgeted amounts.



F-49





D. Debt Policy:



1. The objective of the City’s debt policy is to maintain the City’s ability to incur present and

future debt at the most beneficial interest rates in amounts needed for financing the adopted

Capital Improvement Program without adversely affecting the City’s ability to finance

essential City services.

2. A five-year capital improvements program will be developed and updated annually along

with corresponding anticipated funding sources.

3. Capital projects financed through either bank qualified loan or the issuance of bonded debt

will be financed for a period not to exceed the useful life of the project.

4. Debt service principal payments will be scheduled in equal installments over the life of the

indebtedness.

5. Requirements of continuing disclosure agreements for all bond issues will be complied with,

including annual filing of audited financial statements and adopted budgets, to the Municipal

Securities Rulemaking Board, and all national rating agencies which have assigned a bond

rating for the City.

6. Pay-as-you-go financing will be the normal method of funding the capital program, with debt

financing not to exceed the limits established below.

7. Actual ratios of per capita debt, and debt service to operating expenditures, and the not-to-

exceed limit are shown below.

E. Investment Policy:



In recognition of its fiduciary role in the management of all public funds entrusted to its care, it shall

be the policy of the City that all investable balances be invested with the same care, skill, prudence

and diligence that a prudent and knowledgeable person would exercise when undertaking an

enterprise of like character and aims. Further, it shall be the policy of the City that all investments

and investment practices meet or exceed all statues and guidelines governing the investment of

public funds in Virginia, including the Investment Code of Virginia and the guidelines established by

the State Treasury Board and the Governmental Accounting Standards Board.



Copies of the City’s comprehensive investment policy, including the objectives, allowable

investments, quality, maturity restrictions, prohibited securities, and additional requirements are

available at the Department of Finance.



F-50





F. Fund Balance Policy (adopted by City Council on June 9, 2011):



1. Background and Purpose

a. Sound financial management principles require that sufficient funds be retained by

the City to provide a stable financial base at all times. Adequate levels of fund

balance are essential to protect against reducing service levels because of

temporary revenue shortfalls or unanticipated expenditures. Fund balance provides

resources during the time it takes to develop and implement a longer term financial

solution. Fund balance is also crucial in long-term financial planning and financing as

credit markets carefully monitor levels of fund balance to evaluate creditworthiness.





2. Components of Fund Balance

The following individual items shall constitute the Fund Balance:

a. Nonspendable Fund Balance – Amounts that cannot be spent due to form (such as

inventories and prepaid amounts), and/or amounts that must be maintained legally

intact or contractually intact (such as principal of a permanent fund).

b. Restricted Fund Balance – Amounts constrained for a specific purpose by external

parties, constitutional provisions, or enabling legislation.

c. Committed Fund Balance – Amounts constrained for a specific purpose by City

Council using its highest level of decision-making authority. It would require another

action of the City Council to remove or change the constraints placed on the

resources. Commitments must be established.

d. Assigned Fund Balance – Amounts constrained for a specific purpose by the City

Manager, who has been given the delegated authority by the City Council to assign

amounts. The amount reported as assigned should not result in a deficit in

unassigned fund balance.

e. Unassigned Fund Balance – Amounts not classified as nonspendable, restricted,

committed, or assigned. The General Fund is the only fund that would report a

positive amount in the unassigned fund balance.





3. Funding Requirements of Unassigned Fund Balance of the General Fund

a) An unassigned fund balance shall be established at an amount equal to a minimum

of 35% of General Fund operating revenues as shown in the City’s most recent

comprehensive annual financial report (CAFR).

b) The use of the unassigned fund balance will be permitted to provide temporary

funding of unforeseen emergency needs.

c) If the unassigned fund balance falls below an amount equal to 35% of the General

Fund operating revenues as outlined above, a plan to replenish the fund balance

within twelve months will be presented to the City Council.

d) Unassigned fund balance represents the residual fund balance after the

nonspendable, restricted, committed and assigned fund balance categories are

deducted.



F-51





4. Monitoring and Funding

a) City staff will report on compliance with this Policy during the presentation of the

Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) at the regular meeting of City

Council in December each year.

b) The City shall annually demonstrate that it will comply with this Policy based on its

proposed Operating and Capital Budget for each year.





F-52





INTRODUCTION



The Capital Improvements Projects of the City of Williamsburg are administered through two funds,

the Sales Tax Fund for general improvements, and the Utility Fund for water and sewer projects.

Since 1991, the City has projected five year capital project requirements of all departments. The

current year's projects are funded by City Council, with the remaining four years shown for planning

purposes only. At year end, the funding for any uncompleted project is encumbered as necessary,

and presumed to be finished in the next fiscal year.



Revenues of the Sales Tax Fund are derived from the 1% Sales Tax that is collected and

distributed monthly by the state. All taxable purchases in the Commonwealth of Virginia are charged

at the rate of 5%, one percent of which is returned to localities by law. It has been the policy of the

City Council for over 25 years to use this revenue to fund general capital projects in the City.

Examples of projects completed with the use of these funds are schools, municipal buildings, land

acquisitions, roads, vehicles, and equipment. It is a general fund type, and combined with the

General Fund for financial statement presentation. For budgeting purposes management has

traditionally chosen to keep it separate because of its capital project nature.



The Sales Tax Fund for FY 2013 and beyond will budget and account for interest earnings of the

General Fund. In the past the operating budget has experienced drastic swings in these revenues

caused by extreme changes in interest rates, tending to skew operating budgets. This approach will

help stabilize operations for comparison each year. On the spending side, the City’s annual paving

program will be included as a capital expenditure in this fund, not only because of its capital nature,

but also because of the skewing affect on operations over time. As noted above, the Sales Tax

Fund is ultimately included in the General Fund for financial statement presentation as required by

general accepted accounting principles.



Revenues of the Utility Fund are used to fund capital improvements, as well as operating costs, for

the water and sewer systems.



Capital project detail sheets include a reference to one or more of the specific City Council’s 2011

and 2012 Biennium Goals & Initiatives the project will contribute toward.

Ironbound Road Widening



Category: Public Works



Project title: Street Construction



Project description: Ironbound Road – Longhill Connector to Richmond Road



A corridor study was completed in FY11-12 for Ironbound Road from Treyburn Drive to

the Longhill Connector. Ironbound Road provides access for a variety of urban uses:

residential (inside and outside the City), school facilities (James Blair Middle School and

the College of William and Mary), mixed used development (High Street and New

Town), a future fire station, and potential new development.



The study calls for the widening of Ironbound Road and the need for dual left turns onto

Richmond Road. Also, the intersection at Longhill Road will need to be improved. The

project will include underground wiring and improved pedestrian and bicycle facilities.

Preliminary estimates for the construction phase are based on a three lane roadway,

Longhill Road intersection improvements and an additional lane at the Richmond Road

approach. The VDOT programming estimate for this project is as follows: PE –

$335,000; R/W Utilities – $1,626,000 ($1 million for underground wiring); and

Construction – $1,553,000. The project total is $3,514,000. The City’s share of the cost

of the road work is 2%, and the underground wiring share is 50%.



The City’s cost for the project includes $500,000 for underground wiring and $50,000 for

road construction for a total of $550,000. VDOT will administer the project and bill the

City for its share. Due to State reductions in transportation funding, the construction of

this project is not slated to start until FY16. $335,000 is earmarked for FY16

(engineering) and $1,000,000 for FY17.

Project Title: Street Construction



Project Description: Prince George Street Reconstruction



In conjunction with the 2004 construction of the Prince George Parking Garage, Prince

George St. from N. Henry St. to N. Boundary St. was reconstructed, sidewalks were

bricked and widened, lighting was improved, and street trees were planted. The

construction of Prince George Commons (Mama Mia’s) presents the City with the same

opportunity – a major enhancement of the street in conjunction with a major

development.



The Prince George Street Reconstruction project, between N. Boundary St. and

Armistead Ave., will be of the same character as the improvements made east of N.

Boundary Street, and will include:

• Narrowing Prince George St. by eliminating parking on the north side.

• Widening to 13’ and bricking the sidewalk on the north side of the street adjacent

to the Imperial Building, Colonial Sports and Prince George Commons.

• Widening to 5’ and bricking the sidewalk on the south side of the street, adjacent

to College of William and Mary property.

• Replacing the existing curb and gutter and milling and repaving Prince George

St.

• Upgrading the water and sanitary sewer lines in Prince George St. (Utility Fund)

• Installing new street lights.

• Planting new street trees in tree wells along the north side sidewalk.



The developer of Prince George Commons proffered to construct brick sidewalks and

associated curbs and gutters in conjunction with the redevelopment, which will be

applied toward the cost of this project. Related and separately budgeted are: $40,000

to replace the 8” water line and $15,000 to upgrade the sanitary sewer lines, both in

Prince George St.

Project Title: Underground Wiring/Corridor Enhancement



Project Description: Underground wiring



This project involves replacing all overhead wiring including electric, telephone and

cable television with underground wiring on major corridors identified by City Council

and the corridor beautification plan.



$5.55 million has been invested in underground wiring over the last seven years.

Ironbound Road (JCC project – section in City) was completed in FY11-12.



A new 20 year franchise agreement was awarded to Dominion Virginia Power in FY09.

The franchise agreement identifies four underground wiring projects which are

anticipated to occur during the 20 year franchise period: Quarterpath Road, Page

Street, South Henry Street, and York Street. Quarterpath Road underground wiring will

be paid by Dominion Power. The other three projects are at the City’s expense and are

planned to be direct bury rather than duct bank installations, which will be less

expensive to construct.



Also, as part of the Ironbound Road reconstruction project, wires will be placed

underground. That undergrounding is estimated to occur in FY16, but included as part

of the road project.



The following projects are planned over the next 5 years, and are primarily covered by

Project Description: Municipal Center



The City’s Municipal Center includes the City’s major governmental functions and public

buildings, and covers a 25-acre area centered on City Square on North Boundary

Street. This area has long been the focus of planning efforts by the City. By 1980,

most of the present Municipal Center buildings were in place: the Stryker Building

(1968), Library (1973), Police Station (1978) and Fire Station (1978). Another group of

buildings were completed prior during the 1980s: Arts Center (1982), City Shop (1985),

Municipal Building (1988), and the remodeling of the Stryker Building for the present

City Council Chamber (1989).



A major upgrade to the Municipal Center was completed in 1999 with the creation of

City Square, a large tree-lined green that serves as the area’s centerpiece and defining

element, and which unifies the varied architectural styles of the surrounding buildings.

Surrounding City Square, in addition to the Library (expanded in 1999) and Stryker

Building, is the 153-space Parking Terrace (1999) and the Community Building (1999)

which provides community meeting space in two adjoining meeting rooms. Sites for

three commercial and/or office buildings with approximately 18,000 square feet of floor

area were provided on the west and south sides of the Parking Terrace, and two of

these buildings have been completed. The Transportation Center, the City’s multimodal

transportation hub, was renovated in 2002, and functions as a central terminal for

Amtrak, Greyhound and Trailways bus lines, and Williamsburg Area Transport bus

service. Long-term parking, automobile rental and taxi services are also provided.



Recent improvements to the Municipal Center include a new Emergency Operation

Center and Fire Administration offices as an addition to the Fire Station (2011), and the

expansion and renovation of the Municipal Building (2011). This expansion provided

needed facilities for the City administration, and included space for bringing the City

Attorney’s office and the Williamsburg Redevelopment and Housing Authority into the

Municipal Building.



The next steps in the evolution of the Municipal Center will include the replacement of

the aging Stryker Building with a new Stryker Center fronting on City Square. This new

facility will advance the partnership between the City and the Williamsburg Regional

Library to better meet the city’s governmental needs and to satisfy unmet demands for

civic and community activity space. A site for future development is also reserved on

the southwest corner of North Boundary Street and Lafayette Street, adjacent to the

Stryker Center. In addition, the acquisition of a key lot south of City Square and across

Boundary Street from the Library would complete the 60 year development of the

Municipal Center into the City’s civic center.

Virginia. Each locality has previously authorized the assessment of a courthouse

maintenance fee of $2 for each civil and criminal action and/or traffic case in the District

or Circuit Courts for the City of Williamsburg and James City County.



The Clerk of the Circuit Court collects and remits fees monthly to the City’s Department

of Finance, acting as agent for the Courthouse Maintenance Fund. Funds are invested

in the Commonwealth of Virginia’s Local Government Investment Pool. Disbursements

are approved by resolution of both the Williamsburg City Council and the James City

County Board of Supervisors for capital projects deemed necessary to maintain the

Courthouse.

Project Title: Water Supply



Project Description: Watershed Protection/Water Quality



The City has been aggressive in purchasing watershed property for several decades to

protect our drinking water source. The City now owns or has conservation easements on

57% of the watershed. Money is set aside each year in case property becomes available.

Money is also set aside for other initiatives such as forestry management, security

improvements to the Plant and watershed (signage, access control).

Project Title: Water Distribution/Storage



Project Description: Water System Improvements



Examples of water system improvements include:

• Upgrade line size on developer installed systems (e.g. contribution to 16" extension

to Fairfield Timeshares on Mooretown Road).

• Small line replacement program to improve water pressure in specific areas (past

projects Jefferson Avenue, Adams Street, Penniman Road, Tanyard Street, and

Middletown Farms system).

• Master plan improvements – past projects include 12" water line extension to

Strawberry Plains redevelopment project; 12” extension along Henry Street and

Francis Street for improved flows to the CWF Lodge and Inn area; York Street

extension for redevelopment project.

• Upgrades/replacements of pipelines in conjunction with road construction/

reconstruction projects (e.g. Treyburn Drive, Richmond Road Reconstruction,

Braxton Court).



$40,000 is budgeted in FY13 for an upgraded water line on Prince George Street

(Boundary St. to Armistead Ave.) in conjunction with redevelopment of the Prince George

Commons (MaMa Mia’s). The following projects are anticipated in the next 5 years:





Prince George St. water line upgrade (400’)

FY13

$ 40,000



Pocahontas St. water line upgrade (1600’)

FY15

Fiscal Impact: Scheduled replacement of water system infrastructure should reduce

operating costs. Water extensions add piping to the water system with minor increases in

operating and maintaining infrastructure.

Department: Utility Fund



Project Title: Water Distribution/Storage



Project Description: Water Tank Painting



This project is for the painting of three water storage tanks in the City:



1. 500,000 gallon Jamestown Road elevated tank

2. 500,000 gallon Magruder elevated tank

3. 1,000,000 gallon City Shop ground tank



It is anticipated that complete sandblasting of the tanks will not be required. They were last

painted in 1995.



The City’s 750,000 gallon Quarterpath at Williamsburg elevated tank will be brought online

in FY12-13 and therefore will not require painting.



Estimated Capital Budget:

City Council Initiative:

Sewer System Overflow Prevention



Category:

Utilities

Department: Utility Fund



Project Title: Sewer Collection/Transmission System



Project Description: Sewer System Rehab – SSO Program



All localities in the HRPDC region have been issued a consent order by the State

Department of Environmental Services to virtually eliminate sanitary sewer overflows

(SSOs). SSOs are primarily caused by rainwater inflow and infiltration (I&I) and blockages

caused by grease and roots. The consent order sets goals, deliverables and timetables for

upgrading the region’s sanitary sewer systems. The State initiative is guided by the

Federal Environmental Protection Agency.



The region, City included, will be spending unprecedented amounts of money to “tighten

up” its sanitary sewer system in an effort to control SSOs. Much study effort will be

expended prior to actual rehab/repair/replacement of the infrastructure. While the exact

figures can not be determined until sewer line evaluation work is complete, the City is

setting aside funding each year for the next 5 years. Some of the FY13 money ($15,000)

will be spent on sewer rehab on Prince George Street in conjunction with streetscape

improvements anticipated with Prince George Commons (Mama Mia’s) development.



Estimated Capital Budget:

FY17

Total



$700,000 $700,000 $700,000 $700,000 $700,000 $3,500,000



Fiscal Impact: These expenditures will be a major driver in increasing utility rates. In the

long run, however, upgrading the sewer system will reduce O&M costs.

Project Title: Sewer Collection/Transmission System



Project Description: Sewer Pump Station Reliability/Improvements



There are 14 sewage pumping stations in the City. Because the City drains into shellfish

waters, the stations are classified as Reliability Class I stations which provides for the

strictest standards of reliability. For example, the stations are required to have emergency

back up power or other means of operating the pumps in case of power failure. As part of

the SSO consent order, a MOM (Management, Operation, Maintenance) report was

developed for the sewer system which requires pump station improvements such as wet

well cleaning of all stations. The following is a breakdown of the pump station

improvements included in the CIP.



Station 13 – Stabilize area around station



FY13

$



60,000

Station 14 – Rehab wet well

Fiscal Impact: There will be a minor fiscal impact as pump/motor sizes are increased

energy consumption will also increase but will be buffered by better efficiency and less

maintenance.

Project Title: Water/Sewer System Contingency



Project Description: Water/Sewer System Contingency



Water and sewer system contingency must be budgeted to cover unforeseen items on a

yearly basis. The utility must have the money reserved in order to continue to operate on a

continuous basis. Examples of water and sewer contingencies include:



• Emergencies - major pipeline failures, drought.

• Emergency sewer repairs/rehab.

• Water pump/motor burn out.

• Loss of power and emergency generator failure.

• Drought requiring public notification campaign to conserve water.

• Water/sewer line extensions at property owner request.

• Contributions to new pump stations installed by Development.

• Capital project contingency.

is in the City, just south of the Longhill Connector. Construction is underway,

and the underground wiring has been completed.

Funds (50% match) have been approved for five sidewalk projects which were

completed: Richmond Road from the proposed College development to the

Presbyterian Church and from College Corner to Armistead Avenue (brick

sidewalks), north side of Rt. 199 from Jamestown Road to Exmore Court (Holly

Hills Carriage Homes), South Henry Street from DeWitt Wallace Museum to

Court Street, South Boundary Street west side from Jamestown Road to Grigsby

Municipal Facilities Renewal and Expansion - $900,000 FY11 carryover. The

renovation and expansion of the Municipal Building at 401 Lafayette Street was

substantially completed in October, 2011. A two-story addition was constructed

on the west side of the original building, combined with rehabilitation and a

geothermal energy retrofit of the existing building. The project was completed at

a cost of $6.3 million, which was about $1 million below the original cost

estimate.

available for projects approved by the governing bodies. Procurement of an

upgraded computer security software system was initiated in the fall of 2011 by

James City County staff, and is anticipated to be completed in early 2012, at a

cost of approximately $48,000.



7.

Schools – Renovation and Capital Maintenance Projects - $1.5 Million allocated,

including carryover funds from prior years, for FY12. City contribution to various
