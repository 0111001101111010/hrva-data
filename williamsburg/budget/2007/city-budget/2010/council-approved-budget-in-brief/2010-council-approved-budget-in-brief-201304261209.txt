BALANCING THE BUDGET



Due to the enormous decrease in the amount of revenues resulting from Virginia State budget reductions, general property taxes and other local revenue losses, several budget strategies were implemented to balance this budget. Two fee increases were recommended; EMS rate increase ($186,000) and after-school program fee increase ($210,000). Further budget balancing measures total $14.36 million and include: using fund balance for capital projects and one-time items ($5.59M); use of school construction debt reserve ($664,330); reducing contributions to non-contractual civic and community support agencies ($251,270); organizational-wide operating reductions/ restructuring

($1.57M); reallocation of funding for capital projects from general fund to bond funds

($1.83M); employee benefit changes and savings ($868,023); eliminating 45 permanent full-time positions, several part-time positions and reduced WAE funding ($2.22M); total benefits related to eliminated positions ($624,797); and departmental operating costs reductions ($744,623).

HAMPTON CITY SCHOOLS EXPENDITURES



The total school budget for FY 2010 is $208,713,038, a (3.32%) decrease over FY 2009.

For FY 2010, the initial State budget reduction totaled $14,138,964. However, the Schools will receive an estimated $8,136,617 from the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund.

The total local contribution to the Hampton School System is $68,051,707, a (1.68%) reduction from FY 2009. The required local contribution, according to state law, is $31,369,482. The City’s contribution in excess of the state requirement is $36,682,225.

The local contribution to the schools is based on a mutually agreed upon formula in which they will receive a predetermined percentage of the growth in residential real estate, personal property and utility taxes. The overall reduction for the schools is due to a combination of the Virginia State budget cuts and a decrease in personal property taxes.





The photos above are the new Pre-K-8 Schools under construction as of June 18, 2009; Senator Hunter Booker Andrews (left) and George Perly Phenix (right). On March 11, the Hampton School Board accepted a recommendation to delay the opening of the division’s two PreK-8 schools until 2010.
