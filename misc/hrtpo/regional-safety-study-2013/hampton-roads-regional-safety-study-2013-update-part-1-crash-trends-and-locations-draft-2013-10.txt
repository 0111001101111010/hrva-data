INTRODUCTION


There were a total of 25,192 crashes in Hampton Roads in 2012 – an average of 69 crashes every day throughout the year, or one crash in the region every 21 minutes. These crashes resulted in tens of millions of dollars of damage, 15,034 injuries, and 99 lives lost. Crashes have a wide range of impacts, not only on the transportation system, but also on families, friends, and society as a whole.

Because of these impacts, roadway safety has been a priority in the state and metropolitan transportation planning processes. The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) aimed for a transportation system that provides safe and efficient mobility and accessibility. In 1998, the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) required that Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) incorporate safety and security as a priority factor in their metropolitan planning process. Safety planning also continued as a priority under the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy FIGURE 1 - HRTPO SAFETY PLANNING EFFORTS

The Hampton Roads Regional Safety Study – 2013 Update provides the first full update to the original Hampton Roads Regional Safety Study. Most of the topics included in this update are similar to those included in the original Regional Safety Study, while incorporating new information and methodologies.

The Hampton Roads Regional Safety Study – 2013 Update is produced in two parts. This report (Part I) includes the following sections:  Regional Safety Trends – This section includes information similar to previous General Crash Data and Trends reports. Trends in traffic crashes in Hampton Roads are highlighted, as is information related to injuries and fatalities resulting from traffic crashes.

Crash data for each Hampton Roads jurisdiction is included, and comparisons with other metropolitan areas in Virginia are also

examined.

 Crash Characteristics – This section looks at the characteristics of crashes and fatalities in Hampton Roads. Examples include crash types, driver actions, alcohol usage, speeding, and safety belt usage.

 Crash Locations – This section examines the locations of crashes, DRAFT

injuries, and fatalities on the Hampton Roads roadway system.

Details are provided on how the crash data was collected and

analyzed. The number of crashes for each location is shown, as is the rate based on the severity of crashes and the exposure to

crashes.

 Next Steps – This section highlights the information that will be included in Part II of the Hampton Roads Regional Safety Study – 2013 Update. This includes efforts to improve roadway safety,

general crash countermeasures, and safety improvements for high crash locations.

A reported traffic crash includes all crashes on public roadways that involve a fatality, injury, or estimated property damage of at least $1,500 according to the DMV.

The decrease in the number of crashes has led to a reduced regional crash rate. In 2011 – the most recent year for which vehicular travel data is available – there were 1.65 crashes for every million vehicle-miles of travel (VMT) in Hampton Roads. This crash rate is down 25% from 2.20 crashes per million VMT in the region in 2000 (Figure 3).

The crash rate in Hampton Roads is typical of the crash rates experienced in other metropolitan areas throughout the state. As shown in Figure 4 on DRAFT

CRASH CHARACTERISTICS

CRASH TYPES

Crashes are caused by a number of factors. Many of these factors are The primary crash types in Hampton Roads for the years 2010-2012 (Figure human in nature, such as driver inattention, driving under the influence of 14) were rear end crashes (38.3%), angle crashes (28.2%), and fixed objects alcohol, or speeding. In other cases, factors such as bad weather or off the roadway surface crashes (13.1%). Nearly four out of every five defective equipment may also be a cause.

WEATHER

Although the Hampton Roads climate is temperate compared to

many areas of the country, weather does impact traffic safety in the region. Safety is impacted by a number of factors including poor visibility, slick or flooded pavement, and increased

congestion in bad weather.

Over 15% of all crashes in Hampton Roads between 2010 and 2012

occurred in bad weather conditions such as rain, snow, and fog

(Figure 15). Based on a Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) estimate that 15% of all crashes nationwide occur in rain, snow, or foggy conditions, the Hampton Roads rate is typical.

Weather conditions contribute less of an impact to fatal crashes.

NUMBER OF VEHICLES

Crashes in Hampton Roads typically involve two vehicles.



Between 2010 and 2012, two out of every three crashes in the

region involved two vehicles (Figure 16). Single vehicle crashes constituted 21% of all crashes in the region, while 13% of all crashes involved three or more vehicles.

DRAFT

Fatal crashes, however, typically involve only one vehicle. Over 60% of all fatal crashes in Hampton Roads from 2010 to 2012

involved one vehicle. Slightly less than one out of every three fatal crashes (31%) involved two vehicles, and about 7% of all fatal crashes involved three or more vehicles.

ALCOHOL USAGE

The DMV records whether crashes involve alcohol usage, defined by DMV as crashes where a driver, pedestrian, or bicyclist had been drinking before the crash, regardless of the blood alcohol content. Driving under the influence of alcohol is one of the main causes of fatal crashes in Hampton Roads.

Although only 7.2% of all traffic crashes in Hampton Roads between 2010

and 2012 (Figure 18) involved alcohol, the percentage of all fatalities that involved alcohol was 38.7%.

SPEEDING

Another main cause of fatal crashes in Hampton Roads is speeding.

According to DMV statistics, a total of 17.8% of all traffic crashes in Hampton Roads between 2010 and 2012 included at least one driver exceeding the speed limit or the safe travel speed (Figure 19), regardless of other driver actions that resulted in the crash. Note that this differs from the percentage listed in the Driver Actions data on the previous page, which covers only the primary driver actions. In terms of speed-related fatalities, however, this percentage nearly doubles, at 34.8% of all fatalities.

MOTORCYCLISTS

Many of the fatalities resulting from traffic crashes in Hampton Roads are suffered by motorcyclists. Although only 2.3% of all crashes in Hampton Roads between 2010 and 2012 involved motorcyclists (Figure 20), 50 of the 356 fatalities (14.0%) that occurred in Hampton Roads during this time were motorcyclists.

FREEWAYS

Crashes were analyzed for the entire regional freeway system as part of this study. The regional freeway system network includes all Interstates (I-64, I-264, I-464, I-564, and I-664), as well as the Chesapeake Expressway, MLK

Freeway, Southwest Suffolk Bypass, Suffolk Bypass, Western Freeway, and a portion of Route 199. The freeway system analyzed in this report includes 218 total segments, comprising approximately 178 centerline miles.

The location of each crash on the freeway system was identified using ArcGIS software. HRTPO staff grouped crashes by freeway segment and direction for the initial analysis. The total number of crashes was calculated for each freeway segment for each year of the four-year period from 2009

to 2012, and an annual average was calculated.

Although determining the total number of crashes that occurred on each freeway segment is a necessity for safety analyses, this number does not provide an accurate means of comparing the safety levels between freeway FIGURE 21 – SOUTHSIDE CRASH LOCATIONS IN ARCGIS

order to focus this study, crashes were analyzed for select at-grade intersections in Hampton Roads.

However, the total number of crashes does not provide an accurate means of comparing the safety levels between various intersections, since the Intersections were selected for this study based on their inclusion in the number of vehicles served by each intersection varies greatly. For example, Hampton Roads Congestion Management Process (CMP) roadway network.

the intersection of Independence Boulevard and Virginia Beach Boulevard in The Hampton Roads CMP roadway network is a 1,600 mile network that Virginia Beach (where an average of 110,500 vehicles enter the intersection includes all roadways that are classified as interstates, freeways or other each weekday) would be expected to have many more crashes than the expressways, principal arterials, and minor arterials.

For this study, the “Annual Average Daily Vehicles Entering Intersection”

number in the previous equation was estimated using VDOT’s Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) volumes. The average daily vehicles entering an intersection is equal to half of the sum of the 2-way AADT volumes of each leg of the intersection. For those legs of the intersection where AADT

volumes are not available (such as local roadways or roadways that provide access to areas such as office parks or shopping centers), HRTPO staff estimated AADT volumes.

NEXT STEPS

Part I of the Hampton Roads Regional Safety Study – 2013 Update introduces previous HRTPO safety planning efforts, reports the recent trends in roadway safety in Hampton Roads, details the characteristics of crashes in Hampton Roads, and specifies the number of crashes and crash severity rates at intersections and freeway segments throughout the region.

Part II of the Hampton Roads Regional Safety Study – 2013 Update will build on this Part I report by addressing roadway safety improvements. Sections in the next report will include:

 Efforts to Improve Roadway Safety – There are a number of national and statewide efforts to improve roadway safety.



Examples that will be described in this section include the Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP), educational efforts, Road

Safety Audits (RSAs), and the Virginia Strategic Highway Safety Plan (SHSP).



In addition, new tools have been created to better analyze

roadway safety. The American Association of State Highway

Transportation Officials (AASHTO) recently released the first

edition of the Highway Safety Manual. The primary focus of the Highway Safety Manual is the development of analytical tools to FIGURE 22 – HIGHWAY SAFETY MANUAL

quantify and predict the number of crashes at various facilities.

Source: AASHTO.

This will assist with determining the impact of planning decisions on roadway safety, selecting safety countermeasures, comparing

DRAFT

alternatives, and prioritizing safety projects.



In Part II of this study, HRTPO staff will use the methods described in the Highway Safety Manual to determine the predicted number

of crashes at each of the 597 intersections included in this report, and compare this predicted number with the actual number of

crashes that occurred. This will produce an “Excess Expected

Average Crash Frequency” for each intersection. Another new

tool, developed in National Cooperative Highway Research

Program (NCHRP) Project 17-45, will be used to perform a similar analysis for each of the regional freeway segments.



 General Crash Countermeasures – A wide range of

countermeasures exist to address both general and specific

roadway safety problems. A description of these various crash

countermeasures will be included, as will other general strategies to improve roadway safety.



 Crash Countermeasures for Freeway and Intersection Locations – This Part I report determined locations throughout Hampton Roads with a high number of crashes and a high crash severity rate. Part II of this report will determine locations with a high “Excess

Expected Average Crash Frequency” using methods in the Highway

Safety Manual and NCHRP Project 17-45. Based on these analyses, a number of locations with safety issues will be identified. These locations will be analyzed in detail, including collision diagrams, summaries of crash characteristics at each location, expected

benefits of possible countermeasures, and prioritized

F

recommendations.

Source: HRTPO analysis of VDOT data. Data reflects the years from 2009 to 2012.

FAT = Number of crashes with at least one fatality. INJ = Number of crashes with at least one injury but no fatalities. PDO = Number of crashes with property damage only.

Freeway Crash Severity Rate (per million vehicle-miles of travel) = [1,000,000 x (Annual PDO Crashes + 3 x Annual INJ Crashes + 12 x Annual FAT Crashes)] / [365 x Average Daily Traffic x Segment Length]

Source: HRTPO analysis of VDOT data. Data reflects the years from 2009 to 2012.

FAT = Number of crashes with at least one fatality. INJ = Number of crashes with at least one injury but no fatalities. PDO = Number of crashes with property damage only.

Freeway Crash Severity Rate (per million vehicle-miles of travel) = [1,000,000 x (Annual PDO Crashes + 3 x Annual INJ Crashes + 12 x Annual FAT Crashes)] / [365 x Average Daily Traffic x Segment Length]

Source: HRTPO analysis of VDOT data. Data reflects the years from 2009 to 2012.

FAT = Number of crashes with at least one fatality. INJ = Number of crashes with at least one injury but no fatalities. PDO = Number of crashes with property damage only.

Freeway Crash Severity Rate (per million vehicle-miles of travel) = [1,000,000 x (Annual PDO Crashes + 3 x Annual INJ Crashes + 12 x Annual FAT Crashes)] / [365 x Average Daily Traffic x Segment Length]

Source: HRTPO analysis of VDOT data. Data reflects the years from 2009 to 2012 and includes all crashes that occurred within 250’ of the intersection. This table includes those intersections that are part of the Hampton Roads CMP network as defined in this study.

FAT = Number of crashes with at least one fatality. INJ = Number of crashes with at least one injury but no fatalities. PDO = Number of crashes with property damage only.

Average Daily Entering Volume = The total number of vehicles entering the intersection each day. It is generally equal to half of the Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) volumes from each roadway segment adjacent to the intersection.

Intersection Crash Severity Rate (per million entering vehicles) = [1,000,000 x (Annual PDO Crashes + 3 x Annual INJ Crashes + 12 x Annual FAT Crashes)] / [365 x Average Daily Volume Entering the Intersection]

Source: HRTPO analysis of VDOT data. Data reflects the years from 2009 to 2012 and includes all crashes that occurred within 250’ of the intersection. This table includes those intersections that are part of the Hampton Roads CMP network as defined in this study.

FAT = Number of crashes with at least one fatality. INJ = Number of crashes with at least one injury but no fatalities. PDO = Number of crashes with property damage only.

Average Daily Entering Volume = The total number of vehicles entering the intersection each day. It is generally equal to half of the Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) volumes from each roadway segment adjacent to the intersection.

Intersection Crash Severity Rate (per million entering vehicles) = [1,000,000 x (Annual PDO Crashes + 3 x Annual INJ Crashes + 12 x Annual FAT Crashes)] / [365 x Average Daily Volume Entering the Intersection]

Source: HRTPO analysis of VDOT data. Data reflects the years from 2009 to 2012 and includes all crashes that occurred within 250’ of the intersection. This table includes those intersections that are part of the Hampton Roads CMP network as defined in this study.

FAT = Number of crashes with at least one fatality. INJ = Number of crashes with at least one injury but no fatalities. PDO = Number of crashes with property damage only.

Average Daily Entering Volume = The total number of vehicles entering the intersection each day. It is generally equal to half of the Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) volumes from each roadway segment adjacent to the intersection.

Intersection Crash Severity Rate (per million entering vehicles) = [1,000,000 x (Annual PDO Crashes + 3 x Annual INJ Crashes + 12 x Annual FAT Crashes)] / [365 x Average Daily Volume Entering the Intersection]

Source: HRTPO analysis of VDOT data. Data reflects the years from 2009 to 2012 and includes all crashes that occurred within 250’ of the intersection. This table includes those intersections that are part of the Hampton Roads CMP network as defined in this study.

FAT = Number of crashes with at least one fatality. INJ = Number of crashes with at least one injury but no fatalities. PDO = Number of crashes with property damage only.

Average Daily Entering Volume = The total number of vehicles entering the intersection each day. It is generally equal to half of the Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) volumes from each roadway segment adjacent to the intersection.

Intersection Crash Severity Rate (per million entering vehicles) = [1,000,000 x (Annual PDO Crashes + 3 x Annual INJ Crashes + 12 x Annual FAT Crashes)] / [365 x Average Daily Volume Entering the Intersection]

Source: HRTPO analysis of VDOT data. Data reflects the years from 2009 to 2012 and includes all crashes that occurred within 250’ of the intersection. This table includes those intersections that are part of the Hampton Roads CMP network as defined in this study.

FAT = Number of crashes with at least one fatality. INJ = Number of crashes with at least one injury but no fatalities. PDO = Number of crashes with property damage only.

Average Daily Entering Volume = The total number of vehicles entering the intersection each day. It is generally equal to half of the Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) volumes from each roadway segment adjacent to the intersection.

Intersection Crash Severity Rate (per million entering vehicles) = [1,000,000 x (Annual PDO Crashes + 3 x Annual INJ Crashes + 12 x Annual FAT Crashes)] / [365 x Average Daily Volume Entering the Intersection]

Source: HRTPO analysis of VDOT data. Data reflects the years from 2009 to 2012 and includes all crashes that occurred within 250’ of the intersection. This table includes those intersections that are part of the Hampton Roads CMP network as defined in this study.

FAT = Number of crashes with at least one fatality. INJ = Number of crashes with at least one injury but no fatalities. PDO = Number of crashes with property damage only.

Average Daily Entering Volume = The total number of vehicles entering the intersection each day. It is generally equal to half of the Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) volumes from each roadway segment adjacent to the intersection.

Intersection Crash Severity Rate (per million entering vehicles) = [1,000,000 x (Annual PDO Crashes + 3 x Annual INJ Crashes + 12 x Annual FAT Crashes)] / [365 x Average Daily Volume Entering the Intersection]

Source: HRTPO analysis of VDOT data. Data reflects the years from 2009 to 2012 and includes all crashes that occurred within 250’ of the intersection. This table includes those intersections that are part of the Hampton Roads CMP network as defined in this study.

FAT = Number of crashes with at least one fatality. INJ = Number of crashes with at least one injury but no fatalities. PDO = Number of crashes with property damage only.

Average Daily Entering Volume = The total number of vehicles entering the intersection each day. It is generally equal to half of the Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) volumes from each roadway segment adjacent to the intersection.

Intersection Crash Severity Rate (per million entering vehicles) = [1,000,000 x (Annual PDO Crashes + 3 x Annual INJ Crashes + 12 x Annual FAT Crashes)] / [365 x Average Daily Volume Entering the Intersection]

Source: HRTPO analysis of VDOT data. Data reflects the years from 2009 to 2012 and includes all crashes that occurred within 250’ of the intersection. This table includes those intersections that are part of the Hampton Roads CMP network as defined in this study.

FAT = Number of crashes with at least one fatality. INJ = Number of crashes with at least one injury but no fatalities. PDO = Number of crashes with property damage only.

Average Daily Entering Volume = The total number of vehicles entering the intersection each day. It is generally equal to half of the Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) volumes from each roadway segment adjacent to the intersection.

Intersection Crash Severity Rate (per million entering vehicles) = [1,000,000 x (Annual PDO Crashes + 3 x Annual INJ Crashes + 12 x Annual FAT Crashes)] / [365 x Average Daily Volume Entering the Intersection]
