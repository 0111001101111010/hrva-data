General Overview



The Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) is a five-year expenditure plan to finance the long-term acquisition of property, construction and improvements to facilities and the purchase of equipment.

In essence, it is a funding plan for projects that require a significant capital investment such as those found in Hampton’s Community Plan. The Hampton Community Plan can be accessed on the web at http://www.hampton.gov/community-plan/.



What is a CIP project?



Each locality establishes its own criteria for capital projects. For the City of Hampton, a CIP

project has a cost in excess of $50,000 and a life expectancy of at least five years.



Although the CIP is a means of implementing the recommendations of the Hampton Community Plan, proposed projects are not limited to those listed in the Community Plan. Other projects may include the renovation, maintenance and/or construction of public facilities; road projects; equipment purchase and the acquisition of land for future public use. All projects included in the CIP are classified into one of ten categories:



• Education

• Hampton’s Waterways

• Maintenance/Support of Public

• Master Plans

Properties

• Neighborhood Support

• New Facilities

• Other CIP Projects

• Other Economic Development Support

• Public Safety

• Streets and Infrastructure



Objectives of the CIP

The objectives of the CIP serve to:



 Execute projects which support the Hampton Community Plan and its eight elements sustaining the vision of “Making Hampton the Most Livable City in Virginia.”



 Maintain the City’s current bond rating by ensuring that conservative fiscal parameters are in place to protect the City’s bond rating. The CIP serves as one of many financial guides when making budgetary decisions.



 Address and implement short-term critical initiatives outlined in the Council Approved Strategic Area Master Plans.



 Merge the Hampton City Schools’ strategic plans with the City’s CIP process.



 Prepare the Capital Budget portion of the annual operating budget. The first year of the approved five-year CIP serves as the Capital Budget for that respective fiscal year.



 Balance the needs of new or enhanced economic development with existing development and capital renewal needs.



CIP Process and Discussions



The annual CIP process commences with the distribution of funding request packets.

Suggested projects can come from sources such as City departments, City Council or citizen groups.

Once received, the information is categorized and consolidated in preparation for the CIP Committee meetings.

2





The CIP Committee, composed of senior managers including the Assistant City Managers, Budget Director, Director of Public Works, Economic Development Director, Finance Director and Neighborhood Office/Planning Director, holds a series of meetings to ensure that the current year’s projects continue to be a priority to the City Council and necessary adjustments are made where required. New requests are then reviewed and ranked based on an established set of criteria (legal requirements; investments in maintaining current assets and strategic investments; implementation of Community Plan; and expansion of current service delivery). The Contingency List, which consists of previously submitted projects that were not funded, is also reviewed to determine if any of those projects can now be funded. Newly submitted projects not approved for funding may be placed on the Contingency List for future consideration. The CIP Committee also reviews and confirms the funding sources and the City’s current level of debt to ensure compliance with the Council approved financial policies.



Once a consensus has been reached on the recommended list of projects, yearly schedules are developed for each project’s expenses and paired with a funding source or sources. The proposed list is then forwarded to the Planning Commission for their review and recommendation to the City Council. After the public hearing requirements are met and all discussions have been satisfied, the Planning Commission then forwards to the City Council, by resolution, the recommended CIP.



The City Council also holds a public hearing at which time the recommended CIP is presented. The City Council has the authority to approve the recommended CIP as presented, or approve with amendments. After all public comments have been received and discussions satisfied, the CIP is then adopted, by vote, as the Council Approved CIP. The first year of the approved CIP is incorporated into the Manager’s Recommended Budget as the Capital Budget for the upcoming fiscal year. This is done concurrently with the annual operating budget process which concludes in May.



With the first year of the approved five-year CIP being adopted as the Capital Budget for that respective fiscal year, each subsequent year the CIP must be updated and extended one year into the future so it remains a five-year plan.

FY 2010-2014 Funding Sources



Each project in the FY 2010-2014 Capital Improvement Plan is coupled with one or more funding source. Revenues that the City of Hampton utilize come from several sources such as the federal and state governments, general obligation bonds, dedicated taxes and fees and the General Fund.

Federal and State Government



The federal and state governments provide a great deal of dedicated and one-time funding for specific types of projects such as street improvements. In Hampton’s case, revenues that come from the federal and state governments are Congestion Mitigation Air Quality (CMAQ) Funds; Urban Construction Funds; Urban Development Action Grant (UDAG) Funds and Urban Maintenance Contributions. It is important to note that funding received from these sources may require a cash match from the City.

General Obligation Bonds





The issuance of bonds is another way that many localities fund capital projects. Bond issuances are governed strictly by state laws and regulations. A General Obligation Bond works similarly to a mortgage loan. The issuer (or requestor) of the bond, in this case the City of Hampton, proves its credit worthiness by demonstrating the current level of debt, income and savings, and receives cash in exchange for the promise to repay the loan with interest. The repayment of the bonds is usually long-term, or about 20 years.



4

Typically, government regulations require that the proceeds from a bond issue be expended on one-time capital projects within a certain amount of time after the issuance. For Hampton, bond proceeds will be used to fund the majority of Community Plan projects such as the construction of a new Circuit Court building and a new educational facility in Buckroe. Other projects funded with bond proceeds include a new public safety radio system. The level of debt that the City can incur is governed by Council approved financial policies.

General Obligation Bond Interest





Simply stated, bond interest is the money earned from bond proceeds on deposit until used.

As previously stated, bond proceeds must be expended within a certain time frame. However, until such time as the funds are expended, they remain on deposit and the City has the benefit of using the interest earned for other projects.

Dedicated Taxes and Fees



At times, the City will dedicate revenue received from certain taxes and fees to fund a specific project. For instance, a portion of the revenues received from Stormwater User Fees are dedicated to funding drainage improvement projects.



Contributions from the General Fund



The General Fund is the primary depository for taxes and fees, including real estate and personal property taxes, sales and meal taxes, utility taxes, etc., which are collected for the general operation of the City. The current financial policies dictate that the City can use a minimum of 2%, but no more than 6%, of the estimated General Fund revenues each year for the Capital Budget.



The CIP Committee typically assigns General Fund monies to maintenance-type projects and one-time only capital expenditures.



FY 2010-2014 Category Expenditures





As indicated in the section entitled “What is a CIP Project?” each project included in the CIP falls into one of ten broad categories according to the nature of the project. Brief descriptions of these categories, which are also referred to as expenditure categories, are listed below:

The Education category incorporates funding to:



• support various site improvements at Thomas Nelson Community College (TNCC) as mandated by the Code of Virginia, Chapter 16, Section 23-215 and the Virginia Community College System (VCCS) Policy, Section 10.0;

• support the basic maintenance of public school buildings and grounds;

• aid the public schools with several large projects such as replacing roofs, adding restrooms, refurbishing hallways, etc. and

• construct new public school facilities, as recommended by the School Investment Panel.

The Hampton’s Waterways category includes improvement projects to various waterways in Hampton such as dredging.
