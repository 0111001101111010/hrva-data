General Overview





What is a Capital Improvement Plan?



A Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) is a five-year expenditure plan to finance the acquisition of

property and equipment and to fund new construction and other major improvements to existing public

facilities.



Objectives of the Capital Improvement Plan



The objectives of the Capital Improvement Program serve to:



 Execute projects that support the City of Hampton‟s Community Plan and sustain Hampton‟s vision

of making our community the “most livable community in Virginia.” The Hampton Community Plan

can be accessed on the World Wide Web at www.hampton.gov/community-plan/ under the

“Community Plan” section.



 Prepare the Capital Budget component of what will become the Council Approved Budget. The CIP

serves as one of many planning tools used during the budget development process.



 Maintain and protect the City‟s current bond rating by ensuring that conservative fiscal parameters

are exercised when scheduling and implementing projects.



 Balance the City‟s need for new and/or enhanced economic development with existing development

and capital renewal needs.



 Address and implement critical initiatives outlined in the Council Approved Strategic Area Master

Plans which can be accessed on the World Wide Web at www.hampton.gov/community-plan/ under the “Strategic Master Plans” section.



 Merge the Hampton City Schools‟ capital improvement plans with the City‟s process.





City of Hampton, VA Page FY 2013-2017 Capital Improvement Plan





Project Criterion and Expenditure Categories

Each locality establishes its own criteria for capital projects. The City of Hampton‟s criterion for a

capital project is that it must have a cost in excess of $50,000 and a life expectancy of at least five years.

Although the nature and scope of capital improvement projects vary, each project usually falls into one of the

following ten expenditure categories:



1. The Education project category includes funding to support site improvements at Thomas Nelson Community College (TNCC) and assist Hampton City Schools with maintenance and renovation

projects.



2. The Hampton‟s Waterways project category includes improvements to and maintenance of the

various waterways in Hampton.



3. The Maintenance of Public Properties and Performance Support project category includes

maintenance and/or major improvements, including construction, to existing public facilities and

properties.



4. The Master Plans project category includes projects that implement the Community Plan through various strategic investments.

5. The Neighborhood Support project category includes projects that improve the quality of

neighborhoods through the acquisition and demolition of blighted properties; housing improvement

grants and drainage repairs.



6. The New Facilities project category encompasses construction projects for all new public facilities.



7. The Other CIP Projects category includes projects that do not fit within the other expenditure

categories such as “Contingency,” which covers cost overruns for previously approved General Fund

capital projects.



8. The Other Economic Development Support project category includes projects that provide indirect

aid and support to improve/increase the City‟s economic base.



9. The Public Safety project category includes items specific to the service provision of the City‟s public

safety departments.



10. The Streets and Infrastructure project category includes resurfacing and maintenance of streets,

roads and sidewalks. A tentative street resurfacing plan is developed annually by the City‟s

Department of Public Works and is published on their website at www.hampton.gov/publicworks

under the “What’s New” section.





City of Hampton, VA Page FY 2013-2017 Capital Improvement Plan





Development Process and Discussion of Major Investments for FY

2013



The annual development process commences with reviewing and analyzing funding requests.

Suggested projects come from a variety of sources such as City departments, City Council, citizen groups

and local business communities (referred to as business improvement districts [BIDs] in the City of

Hampton). It is recommended that project submissions from citizen groups and BIDs be submitted through

and advocated by a City department to ensure the required due diligence is performed (i.e. feasibility and

cost analysis). At the conclusion of the review process, the CIP Committee meetings commence.

The CIP Committee is comprised of Assistant City Managers, Director of the Office of Budget and

Management Analysis, Director of Economic Development, Director of Finance, Director of Community

Development, Director of Public Works, Debt Manager, a Hampton City Schools representative and the CIP

Coordinator. Over several months, the CIP Committee takes the steps listed below, in general terms, to develop a proposed plan.



Ensure the relevancy of the current year‟s projects in light of any recent developments and

adjust where necessary.



Review and categorize all new requests into one of the ten expenditure categories. The CIP

Committee then ranks each project based on an established set of criteria (i.e. legal

requirements; investments in maintaining current assets; strategic investments;

implementation of Community Plan and expansion of current service delivery).



Review the list of previously submitted unfunded projects to determine if they can now be

considered for funding.



Review and confirm various revenue sources available.

Community educational forums and „citizen chats‟ are also held during the CIP development process

and prior to any public hearings. These events provide the community with the opportunity to learn about the

process and communicate their priorities, values and concerns for various project areas. The feedback received from the community is weighed during the decision making process.



Once the CIP Committee has reached a consensus on a proposed Plan, yearly expenditure and

revenue schedules are developed for each project. The Committee also determines whether the proposed

Plan is in compliance with the City‟s Financial Policies as it relates to debt capacity and affordability. The

proposed Plan is presented to the public and each of the governing bodies (Planning Commission and the

City Council) at their respective public hearings. Only the City Council has the authority to approve a balanced five-year Plan, either “as presented” or “with modifications.” This action occurs prior to the April

15th submission of the Manager‟s Recommended Budget to the City Council. The first year of the approved

five-year plan is incorporated in the Manager‟s Recommended Budget as the Capital Budget component.

The remaining years of the five-year plan are referenced to as “planned years.” At the beginning of the next

planning cycle, one year is added so that the plan remains a “five-year” plan.

Development Process and Discussion of Major Investments for FY

2013 (Cont’d)



In light of the continued economic challenges such as declining real estate values and relative flat

revenue growth, the majority of projects included in the Capital Budget are focused on maintaining current

assets while minimizing the fiscal impact of project implementation on the operating budget, including debt

service payments. However, there are two significant recurring expenditures included in the fiscal year 2013

Capital Budget which are listed below with further explanation:



Hampton Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) ……. $1,183,000:

Chesapeake Bay Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) …...…………… $1,000,000:

Inclusion of these two capital projects is the result of environmental mandates imposed by the

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality

(DEQ). It is estimated that these projects will be completed in 25 years.



The Hampton Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) is a system which monitors and

collects data on all sanitary sewer pump stations in the City of Hampton. The age and limitations of Hampton‟s existing SCADA system have contributed to the recommendation to replace the aging system.

Accurate data collection is the initial phase in what will be a series of projects to update and/or replace portions of the sanitary sewer system. These expenses are driven by the EPA and DEQ Consent Order

requirements mandating the reduction, and eventual elimination, of sanitary sewer overflows. Several years

ago, when the Consent Order was first negotiated, the Hampton City Council agreed to implement a

surcharge on the Sewer User Fee to both pay for and isolate these expenses. With increasing obligations,

City Council approved to increase the Sewer User Fee from $0.44 per 100 cubic feet of water

consumption to $0.66 per 100 cubic feet of water consumption. The base rate of $1.48 per 100 cubic

feet for general sewer maintenance remains unchanged. For the typical resident, this rate increase will have

a total annual impact of $14.52.

.

The Chesapeake Bay Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) will involve a series of projects (Best Management Practices [BMPs]), based on the result of various watershed studies, that will be designed to

limit nutrient and pollution runoffs into the Chesapeake Bay. The watershed studies will be utilized to determine the location and type of BMP to be installed or retrofitted, such as bioretention, wet ponds, etc.

These activities will be funded by an increase in the Stormwater User Fee (commercial and residential). The

Stormwater User Fee is the legal vehicle the Commonwealth of Virginia gives localities to generate revenue

in order to comply with the mandates for dealing with the water quality management guidelines emanating

from the Federal government through the EPA. The DEQ then monitors localities‟ performance in meeting

the requirements. The previous rate of $4.60 per month will be increased to $6.41 per month, for a total

increase of $1.81 per month or $21.72 per year. The commercial property rate will also increase by the

same flat amount per ERU (equivalent residential unit), which in Hampton is 2,429 square feet of impervious

area. This increase also funds recommendations made by Hampton‟s Citizen Waterways Management

Report to address items such as water quantity due to sea level rise. Other recurring expenses relate to

educating the community on steps they can take to minimize the amount of nutrients entering the waterways.

Please refer to the “Supplemental Information” for a schedule of Taxes and Fees.





The Capital Budget does include one significant, nonrecurring capital expenditure for which the City

of Hampton is also mandated to implement.



Animal Shelter ………………………………….……………………………. $3,000,000:



Virginia State Code §3.2-6546 requires the provision and maintenance of a pound or shelter

where animals that are trapped or collected from the City or surrendered by its owner can be

taken. The City, along with other Hampton Roads localities, is currently under a contract with

the Peninsula SPCA (SPCA) to provide shelter services. Hampton provides its own field

services. The SPCA has notified participating localities that as of July 1, 2013, they will no longer

provide the legal statutory pound services. The City of Hampton seized the opportunity, in

cooperation with other Hampton Roads localities, to construct a regional animal shelter facility.



Funding Source Descriptions



Listed below are the four broad revenue categories which are used to fund capital projects in fiscal

year 2013. Over the next five year period, a large portion of financing for certain capital projects will come

from General Obligation Bonds and dedicated Sewer User and Stormwater Fees.



Federal and State Government Revenues are typically one-time and dedicated for specific types

of projects such as street and road improvements. On occasion, a cash match may be required from

the City. Revenue sources under this category include:



o Urban Maintenance Contributions (UMC-VDOT) {represents the City‟s match} $5,138,774

o Urban Development Action Grant Funds ………………………………….. $ 152,628



General Obligation Bond proceeds are revenues received from municipal bonds which are used to

fund major one-time-only capital expenditures and limit the amount of public funds designated for

new projects/construction. The level of debt that Hampton can incur is governed by the Council

approved financial policies. Revenue sources under this category include:



o General Obligation Bond Proceeds (City) ………………………………….. $5,000,000

o General Obligation Bond Proceeds (Schools) ……………………………… $5,287,500



Dedicated Taxes and Fees are revenues received from certain taxes and fees, as well as land

sales, to fund specific projects. Revenue sources under this category include:



o Economic Development Fund ……………………………………………..… $ 250,000

o Stormwater Fund ………………………………………………………………. $2,495,000

o Wastewater Fund ………………………………………………………………. $1,183,000





City of Hampton, VA Page FY 2013-2017 Capital Improvement Plan





Funding Source Descriptions (Cont’d)





Contributions from the General Fund, which is the City‟s major Fund used to account for all

financial resources not accounted for in any other Fund, generally support maintenance-type

projects and one-time only capital expenditures. Revenue sources under this category include:



o General Fund Balance Transfer ……………………………………………… $2,500,000

o General Fund Operating Revenue ……………………………………………. $3,232,265

Organizational Policy Framework

The Code of Virginia requires that all local governments in the State formulate and adopt a comprehensive

plan to serve as a general guide for its growth and development. In 1989, the City Council adopted a community

plan which provided a foundation for City policy, planning and budgeting initiatives. The initial plan, the 1998

Strategic Plan, was later updated concurrently with the 2010 Comprehensive Plan and adopted by City Council on

February 6, 2006. The results was a single and integrated Hampton Community Plan (2006, as amended) which

provided a stronger link between the short-term program recommendations of the Strategic Plan and the long-

term, physical recommendations of the Comprehensive Plan. These two plans allowed for a single, more

streamlined and effective community participation process. Approximately every five years, the adopted plan is

reviewed to ensure that it remains relevant and current with respect to community aspirations and challenges.



In October 2010, the City of Hampton in cooperation with the Hampton City Schools, initiated a five year review of the Hampton Community Plan. The focus of this community-wide review and dialogue was to update the

City’s vision, strategic issues, goals and ways to measure progress. Ten focus groups made up of citizen volunteers, subject matter experts and staffs were created to formulate ideas and recommendations. The focus

areas included: economic base, education, pride, waterways, housing, government, youth, families, safety and

environment. For several months, the groups worked to redefine the vision and goals for the areas they represented that led to the final version of this important policy document On October 6, 2011, Community Plan

Update 2011 was unanimously endorsed the by Hampton Planning Commission and by Hampton City Council on

November 9, 2011.

Financial Policy Statements





Equity Funding Policy #4A



The financial parameters for pay-as-you-go funding for capital improvement projects are that no less than two

percent (2%), but no more than six percent (6%) of estimated General Fund revenues for the annual operations of the

City, less School Funds from Other than City, shall be devoted to capital expenditures. The total estimated General Fund revenues for fiscal year 2013 are $304,082,882. To adhere to this policy, contributions from General Fund (GF) revenues, which include General Fund Balance Transfer, General Fund Operating Revenues and Urban Maintenance

Contributions, cannot be less than $6,081,658 and no more than $18,244,973. The total amount of General Fund revenues being used to fund capital projects is $10,871,039 or 3.6% which is within the City’s financial parameters.



Equity Funding Policy #4B



A second tier to the City’s financial policy, which was adopted by City Council on April 11, 2007, states a minimum of 10% to 15% of the total capital improvement expenditures over a rolling five year period shall be funded

from General Fund revenues. The fiscal years 2013-2017 Capital Improvement Plan totals $154,229,168 and the 10% to

15% minimum to be funded from General Fund revenues is equal to $15,422,917 and $23,134,375, respectively. The

City anticipates funding $55,546,040 or 36% from General Fund revenues. This amount is in compliance with the policy parameters.



While City revenues provide funding for some capital projects, revenues are also received from other sources

such as the Federal and State government in the form of Urban Development Action Grant (UDAG) Funds. Over the

next five year period, however, a large portion of the funding will mainly come from General Obligation Bonds proceeds and revenues from increases in Stormwater User Fees (residential and commercial) and the Sewer Surcharge Fees.

It is the long-term goal of the City to use pay-as-you-go funding for annual, recurring maintenance-type projects

and use funding from General Fund Balance for construction and Economic Development projects. Bond proceeds are

used to fund major, one-time only capital expenditures and limit the amount of public funds designated for new projects/new construction.
