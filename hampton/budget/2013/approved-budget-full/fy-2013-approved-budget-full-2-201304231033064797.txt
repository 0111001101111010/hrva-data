THE	DISTINGUISHED	BUDGET

PRESENTATION	AWARD



The Government Finance Officers Association of the United States and Canada (GFOA)

presented a Distinguished Budget Presentation Award to the City of Hampton, Virginia

for its annual budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2011. In order to receive this

award, a governmental unit must publish a budget document that meets program

criteria as a policy document, as an operations guide, as a financial plan, and as a

communications device.

This award is valid for a period of one year only. We believe our current budget

continues to conform to program requirements, and we are submitting it to GFOA to

determine its eligibility for another award.

READER'S GUIDE TO THE

CITY BUDGET

The City budget is an annual plan for the coordination of revenues and expenditures. The purpose of the budget

is to provide information about the city’s operations and financial plans to citizens, elected officials and other interested parties. The budget provides a summary of information concerning all city departments, programs and

services.

Each year, the budget development process includes a review of programs and services, the Hampton

Community Plan, the annual operating goals and priorities established by City Council, departmental work plans, the performance contracts of city department heads, and financial data. The process involves collaboration and

input from city agencies and staff, City Council, and citizens through various meetings, presentations, and public forums. The Hampton City Council approves the annual budget. The budget presented in this document covers

the period of July 1, 2012 through June 30, 2013.

MANAGER’S	MESSAGE





April 13, 2012



Mayor Ward, City Council Members and Citizens,



Enclosed you will find the FY 2013 Manager’s Recommended Budget, totaling $428,935,116,

a 0.03% increase over the adopted FY 2012 budget. Of this grand total, the City portion is

$240,061,159 – $3,837,271 less than last year, a 1.57% decrease – and the School portion is

$188,873,957 – $3,982,484 more than last year, a 2.15% increase.



This has been, by far, the most challenging budget in my career with the City. Declining real

estate values (4.5% citywide, all property types) coupled with flat revenue growth in other major

sources have made for a budget that necessitated both continued cuts and minor revenue increases.

Mandatory pension increases passed on by the State put further pressure on limited resources. I am

pleased, however, that we were able to balance the budget without resorting to a tax increase in either

the real estate or personal property taxes. Such an increase would have certainly been justified given

the compounding effect of decreasing housing values for more than three years. A tax rate adjustment

would have produced more revenue and still reduced residents’ overall property tax bills because of

the 6% decline in the residential housing assessments. However, our goal has always been – and will

always be – to avoid such rate changes unless absolutely necessary. A combination of cuts, supported

by public input, and minor adjustments in the meals tax, cigarette tax and motor vehicle licensing fee

have allowed us to keep our real estate tax rate constant at $1.04 per $100 of valuation for the 5th

straight year. Hampton’s real estate tax rate continues to be one of the lowest of the regional urban

localities.

MANAGER’S	MESSAGE





To achieve this, cuts were necessary to most city departments. These cuts may not appear large in

most cases; however, the effect is nevertheless great. After multiple years of cuts, the remaining

manning and operations budget for city departments is very thin. Any cut is painful and has

consequence. It will be important for the Council and citizens to understand, as we move forward, that

responsiveness may be somewhat slower than in the past – and in some case, which I will outline in

more detail later in this message, service levels will change.



To help put this in perspective, I share the following chart that is an excellent proxy for the

efficiency already present in the City budget. As a service-oriented business, the majority of our cost is

personnel. To compare our efficiency, we have looked at the per capita manning for comparable urban

jurisdictions. All employees from all departments and all funds are included to ensure “an apples to

apples” comparison.

The data clearly establishes our organizational efficiency. Only Chesapeake has fewer staffing

per capita, and then the variation is minor. Other cities have significantly more manpower per capita.



Nevertheless, we knew it would be fiscally irresponsible to make up the nearly $12 million

deficit we faced exclusively with revenue increases. All city departments except police and fire were,

therefore, asked to submit 3%, 5% and 7% budget reduction scenarios. While we were able to avoid

the most drastic of the cuts submitted, a little more than half of the funds needed to bridge the gap were

achieved through internal savings and recommended cuts.



I cannot overemphasize the ongoing importance of citizen input in helping to shape the

direction and magnitude of those cuts. Over the last several months, we have continued the extensive

budget outreach we began two years ago. We added new components, including a random-scientific

based telephone survey, and increased the numbers of residents who participated – no small feat given

the past two year’s efforts. We undertook this effort because we understand that a budget should, as

much as possible, reflect citizen values. While all of our services are important, we understood that

cuts would once again need to be made – given the continued effects of the recession – and that any cut

we would offer would be disappointing to some. As a result, we wanted to have as clear an

understanding as possible about what the citizenry tolerance for further cuts would be.



While there is not a perfect correlation between the input received from citizens and our final

recommendations, the citizen’s voices and thumbprints are embedded throughout. Citizens voiced

strong support for maintaining basic city services at current levels although expressed a willingness to

look at varying service hours for facility-based operations. Hence, the departments and services with

the highest support – such as fire, emergency services, police and public works – are largely untouched

in this budget. Cuts are more targeted than in past years, with those cuts directly relating to the areas

citizens expressed a willingness to explore.



In particular, this budget does recommend scaling back service hours at many of our facilities

open for the education and enjoyment of our residents. The History Museum, community centers and

libraries will have some modifications to hours. Libraries will open a little later in the morning (10

a.m. instead of 9 a.m. on Monday-Thursday, and 1 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays) and close a little

earlier (8 p.m. instead of 9 p.m.). Community Centers will be closed on Mondays during the school

year (September – May). To support the needs of our youth when school is out, we will retain our full

service schedule all summer. The History Museum will also be closed on Mondays. These changes

were supported in public and on-line polling by a clear majority (nearly 70% or more in each of these

cases) of the public.



Other expenditure cuts also aligned with public input. This budget recommends mulching city

and school grounds only once a year (supported by 86% of poll respondents); reducing the planting of

annuals on roadways and medians (supported by 71%); reducing printed materials and using the web

as a primary source of communication (supported by 78%); and, delayed upgrading of software

(supported by 63%). The Citizens Unity Commission was again reduced (supported by 54%), although

in a way that will allow continued services. Due to the retirement of the Executive Director, we were

able to save money by proposing to instead hire a part-time director and/or contract out the

management.



In two cases, the public supported potential reductions, but we opted not to take the cut given

the likely negative consequences of such action. Night and weekend 311 assistance was supported as a

potential elimination by 57% of the public polled. However, this is an area where Hampton uniquely

positions itself to assist residents. Many residents work during the day and are unable to call to request

service and/or information from their jobs – nearly 20% of all 311 call volume comes from these non-

traditional hours. We believe that offering night and weekend service is critical to being a responsive

MANAGER’S	MESSAGE





government. Indeed, other cities – including Newport News – are beginning to replicate the Hampton

model. The minor savings we could have achieved were not worth the loss of service to residents who

use the service during evenings and weekends.



Also, residents supported slower turn-around for building permits and inspections. However,

this is an area in which responsiveness can have a long-term negative impact for the image developers,

contractors and residents have of the City. If it is easier to get permits, or inspections, in other cities, it is likely that businesses and citizens may instead look to neighboring jurisdictions when all else is

equal in terms of investments they are looking to make. Indeed, Hampton already suffers from a less

than stellar image of our Land Development Services division. Reductions in this area would have

been potentially devastating.



To correct this less-than-ideal image, we have spent the last several months reviewing

reengineering recommendations and benchmark communities for possible ways to dramatically

improve customer experience with our Land Development Services functions. The incremental

improvements we have been able to make over the last two years have not been enough to change our

image or service responsiveness, so a major overhaul of operations is now appropriate. Our review of

best practices and a reengineering study conducted with the help of business and residential customers

have established that we do not have the best process. Skill sets and job requirement are significantly

outdated. We also have not kept up with the new technological advances that other jurisdictions are

using to allow on-line processing and review of these land-related permits. Accordingly, this budget

recommends the necessary overhaul to fix these issues. The improvements will cost slightly more

money – some of which will be supported with a new technology fee of $10 per permit application –

however, this change is absolutely necessary if we are to re-establish competitiveness in this critical

area of service. Most importantly, adjusting our service model now ensures that Hampton is able to

maximize development/redevelopment opportunities when the recession is over and both residential

and commercial growth returns. Only by being proactive in these areas can we best work to attract new

business and residents so that current homeowners do not have to pick up larger and larger shares of

city services.



Other similar management changes are recommended in this budget, although none as dramatic

as the Land Development Services overhaul. While looking for possible savings in the budget, we

challenged our team to focus on protecting services Hampton does uniquely well (like 311) and to

focus on how others might better assist us in areas where we are not solely qualified to deliver that

service. Two areas stood out as opportunities to diversify to others who could perform services better

than the City.



Our youth violence prevention efforts are critical to building an even stronger community. It

was appropriate that City invest in gang awareness and prevention efforts. However, we are not

uniquely qualified to do this work. While our Police will continue their role in these efforts – and the



Office of Budget and Management Analysis

MANAGER’S	MESSAGE





grant-funded Youth Connect program will remain – we determined that we did not need a full-time

professional staff member guiding these efforts. Instead, a better use of limited funds would be to

invest in existing grass-roots organizations that need help taking their already successful efforts to

scale. Accordingly, we have proposed elimination of this position and will instead establish a targeted

grant program. We believe this will enable us to reach and impact more young people faster.



Similarly, the City is not uniquely qualified to offer programming and services to our teen

population. Several years ago, we opened a Teen Center. Attendance was less than expected. Although

we have improved participation this year, it is clear that the model for success needs to change. There

are many potential partner programs that have a proven track record at engaging young people

successfully. Rather than continuing a model of city programming at the facility, this budget

recommends that the City role shift to caretaker and scheduler of the building and instead focus on

bringing these partners in to program the facility. This shift both saves money and makes sense.



Still other savings were achieved through the retirement incentive program offered by Council.

In some cases, positions being vacated by retirees are filled but at a lower salary than that paid with the

more senior employee retiring. In other cases, the retirement has allowed us to eliminate or restructure

the position. I have already noted the change to contracted and/or part-time management of the

Citizens Unity Commission (CUC). Our Arts Commission Director also opted for retirement. In lieu of

filling that position with a full-time employee, we will instead contract with the Arts Foundation at half

the cost. This will begin a multi-year transition plan to increase Arts Foundation financial support over

time, allowing the City to decrease its annual contribution. The retirement of one of the four Police

Majors has also allowed us to eliminate one high-level management position as the Chief is

comfortable operating with three, instead of four, Majors.



These changes – coupled with higher attrition allocations to departments, transfers of a handful

of positions to the appropriate special revenue funds and a declining debt service expense – enabled us

to close more than half the initial budgetary gap we faced. Deeper cuts would have been devastating

and, according to polling data, not supported by the majority of the public.



We, therefore, looked to potential revenue to offset the lost revenue from real estate declines.

We have chosen to build a package of adjustments – instead of focusing exclusively on one revenue

source such as the real estate or personal property tax – to support the recurring costs of governmental

service. We believe our package ensures that both residents – and non-residents – contribute to the cost

of general government.



We are first proposing to increase the meals tax by 1%. This rate, if approved, would be

equivalent to the proposed rate for our neighboring locality and closest competitor, Newport News.

The meals tax is assessed on all prepared meals within the restaurants of our community. Eating out is

a discretionary activity, meaning that if one wants to avoid the impact of this minor change, they can



Office of Budget and Management Analysis

1 - 5

City of Hampton





MANAGER’S	MESSAGE





certainly opt to do so. Moreover, the impact of a 1% change is negligible. On a $10 meal, the increase

amounts to a dime; on a fancy, $100 meal, the increase is but a dollar. Although the incremental

amount a restaurant goer may pay is small, the sum total of this change is major. A 1% increase

generates more than $2.3 million a year. Because of the many new offerings in Hampton, this tax is

paid not only by Hampton residents but also, and in an increasing amount, by visitors from other

communities.



As we did last year, we also propose to raise the cigarette tax, from the current 75 cents per

pack to 85 cents per pack. This change generates about $265,000 a year for the City and individuals

can avoid paying added costs by changing habits and/or commuting to other, more outlying

communities. Newport News has also proposed raising this rate, so we would remain competitive with

them if we follow suit.



Finally, we have proposed a $5 per year increase in the motor vehicle license fee. This is a flat

amount of $5 per registered vehicle. This fee is paid by residents, businesses and even tax-exempt

property owners, meaning that all Hampton residents (not just those with real estate ownership) will

contribute to closing the budgetary shortfall we face. The $5 per vehicle per year generates close to

$650,000 a year.



Some user fee and permits charges will also change this year, to better account for the actual

costs of providing the various permit reviews and/or inspections. New this year is fire inspection fees

that are standard in other cities. Hampton has historically not charges these fees; however, as they are a

routine cost of doing business throughout the area, we are missing out on having direct customers

cover some of the direct cost of servicing their needs. These fees are earmarked to the Fire & Rescue

Department’s equipment needs. These fees do not impact the average resident.



Because of expensive environmental mandates being imposed on localities by the

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality

(DEQ), increases in wastewater and stormwater fees are also required. These fees are isolated in

special revenue accounts, meaning that the revenue can only be used to support activities that meet the

environmental mandates. The wastewater expenses are driven by a Consent Order mandating a

reduction, and eventual elimination, of sanitary sewer overflows. Several years ago, when the Consent

Order was first negotiated, the Council agreed to implement a surcharge on the sewer user fee to both

pay for and isolate these expenses. With increasing obligations, that surcharge needs to be increased

from $0.44 per 100 cubic feet of water consumption to $0.66 per 100 cubic feet of water consumption.

The base rate of $1.48 per 100 cubic feet for general sewer maintenance remains unchanged. For the

typical resident, this rate increase will have a total annual impact of $14.52.



Similarly, the Stormwater user fee will increase to address Total Maximum Daily Load

(TMDL) requirements to limit nutrient and pollution runoffs into the bay that all Hampton Roads



Office of Budget and Management Analysis

MANAGER’S	MESSAGE





localities are facing. In Hampton’s case, we have aligned these requirements with the input and

recommendations from our Citizen Waterway Management report – meaning that we can get “double

bang” for the dollars invested. Nevertheless, these new investments cost money that will force us to

raise our current rate of $4.60 per month to $6.41 per month, a total increase of $1.81 per month or

$21.72 per year. The commercial property rate also increases by the same flat amount per ERU

(equivalent residential unit, which in Hampton is 2,429 sq. ft. of impervious area).



Even with these changes, our rates will remain very competitive for urban localities. Sewer user

fee and Stormwater user fee comparisons follow.

Altogether, these changes still represent a tax-break for the average resident. Assuming the

average residential valuation decrease of 6%, a typical homeowner with a $200,000 home and two

vehicles would see the following net change in the amount of taxes and user fees paid next year.

I am pleased that we were able to provide this type of additional savings – the above example of

conditions we faced.



Again, this has not been without pain. Critical city services, as noted above, are being curtailed

and reduced. The local school contribution has also declined as required by the local funding formula.

This funding formula was developed nearly fifteen years ago, and has always been honored by both the

City and the School System. Under the formula, 61.83% of all residential real estate, personal property

and utility tax revenue are given to the School System as its “fair share” of the local revenue stream,

while the remaining amount is left to the City budget to support other core needs. Had we ignored this

historical assignment of funds, the City cuts (or revenue increases) would have been more severe. Even

with this reduction in the formula-based local contribution, the School System budget does grow by

nearly $4 million while the City budget declines by a nearly like amount. The School System has asked

for consideration of a dedicated tax increase to offset the loss of local contribution necessitated by this

formula – although indications are that a State budget compromise may mitigate the need for such an

increase. As of the writing of this budget overview, details of the State budget compromise are not

MANAGER’S	MESSAGE





available. Accordingly, I have not included the School request in my recommendation. Council and

School Board conversations will continue once more details emerge.



Thus far, I have focused on the major reductions or changes in management approach

contained in this budget. However, there are a few enhancements of which I am particularly proud.

Last year, we began a multi-year effort to convert the HELP Night’s Welcome Program from a winter-

based program to a year-round effort. This successful community partnership was expanded in FY

2011 to offer shelter on days and evenings during extreme weather events. In FY 2012, we added four

additional weeks of service. HELP agreed to work with us to add a month of service each fiscal year

until we were able to assist this vulnerable population all year long. In keeping with this commitment,

we have added the funds ($11,000) necessary to expand service in FY 2013.



This budget also contains a substantial investment in our Waterways. Building on past

investments – such as the $4.1 million Factory Point restoration/Back River dredging and the $1.2

million Hampton River dredging – Council has approved a $19 million five-year plan for addressing

recommendations made by the citizen Waterways committee. Included in the capital budget in FY

2013 is nearly $3 million for:





 Watershed studies that identify area-specific mitigation solutions

 Implementation of watershed study findings

 Salt Ponds maintenance dredging— now on three-year cycle

 A Best Management Practices Plan to meet Bay cleanup mandates, specifically Phase II WIP

consistent with the TMDL two-year milestone requirements

 Use of the LIDAR data to drive program prioritization – develop study of current and future

probable tidal flooding impacts

 Study of the Transfer of Development Rights and/or Purchase of Developmental Rights to

promote the creation/preservation of natural areas in environmentally sensitive or flood prone

areas

 Support for the regional sediment management plan



The operations budget in the general and Stormwater funds will also support:



 Hiring an experienced grant-writer to obtain public, non-profit, foundation and private funding

for implementation needs

 Staff support to help organized and support citizen advocacy groups/grass-roots lobbying

efforts to obtain funding sources such as land conservancy tax credits, site sponsorships and

commercial marketing to implement the shoreline management program

 Enhanced public programs to educate the public on the value and benefits of shoreline

protection



Office of Budget and Management Analysis

1 - 9

City of Hampton





MANAGER’S	MESSAGE





 More effective programs for warning those living in areas in which imminent flooding is

anticipated just prior to the arrival of bad weather

 Staff support to identify easements and develop easement language to accomplish protection of

shorelines where there is a willingness to do so and to identify methods of enforcement of

existing regulations utilizing non-law enforcement agencies





All of these capital and operating initiatives are directly responsive to the Council’s continued

commitment to protecting and enhancing our community waterways. I believe it is significant that we

have been able to address so many initiatives in a very fiscally constrained budget year.



Finally, I would like to address impacts on the workforce of these budgetary choices. The most

challenging aspect of this budget is the impact on our workforce. Although the budget reductions we

have made will have minimal impact on the workforce, any loss of positions is difficult when the

organization is so thinly manned. The total net loss of positions in this budget is ten (10) permanent

full-time positions. Many of these are vacant, and for those which are not, we should be able to find

alternative placements elsewhere in the organization. I am encouraged that, through our continued

management of vacant positions and retirement incentives, we already have many open positions in

which impacted employees may potentially be placed.



Our remaining workforce deserves much credit for their tireless dedication and their

willingness to “do more with less” over the last three years, during which they did not receive a pay

increase. Whether it is the “big” things (like clearing our community after natural disasters) or the

“little” things (like the day-in and day-out service delivery they execute most times so flawlessly), the

workforce continually excels.



It had been my hope to provide a long-overdue and well-deserved base salary increase this

year. Unfortunately, a State mandate from Richmond has again made this impossible within the fiscal

constraints we face. The General Assembly has mandated that local employees begin to pay a 5%

share of their retirement benefit. While no one disagrees in principle that employees should contribute

to their retirement package, the 5% share would represent a pay cut – on top of three years with no pay

increases – that is just too much to ask employees to bear. The General Assembly has thus mandated a

5% increase in pay for employees, although 5% does not offset the additional costs employees must

bear as that added increase comes with FICA taxes for both the City and the employee. To ensure that

our employees do not lose pay, the City must add an additional $1.7 million to the budget to give the

employees a full offset of this change. This pay adjustment will only keep employees constant in their

tax home pay today, so although the 6% salary adjustments sounds like a good deal for employees, it

will not give them additional take-home pay.



Had we not been forced to spend this money just to make employees whole, the $1.7 million

would have been sufficient to give a merit-based pay adjustment. With these funds now being



Office of Budget and Management Analysis

1 - 10

City of Hampton





MANAGER’S	MESSAGE





consumed to deal with the VRS offset issue, there is not sufficient recurring revenue to add to the base

salary increase. Instead, I am proposing a compensation package made up of one-time monetary and

non-monetary incentives.



The monetary component of this package builds on – but modifies – the performance payment

we gave to employees last year. Last year, permanent full-time employees (who had a 3 or higher merit

rating) received $500, after taxes, and permanent part-time/WAES (also with a 3 or higher merit

rating) received $250. The payment was given in one-lump sum in the first paycheck of the year. This

year, I am proposing we build on this structure and provide our employees the opportunity to earn up

to $1,000, after taxes. This amount is being suggested to ensure that employees earn more than they

did last year.



Our performance payment would be split into two different payments, at the request of many

employees, and would be tiered to differentiate between the performance ratings achieved on the merit

review. For permanent full-time employees garnering a rating of 4 or 5, the $1,000 one-time payment

would be offered, with half in July and the other half in December. For permanent full-time employees

earning a 3 merit rating, the one-time payment would be for a total of $750, again with half in July and

the other half in December. Permanent part-time/WAE employees would be eligible to earn $250,

assuming they have a rating of 3 or higher.



In so structuring this compensation to employees, we are focusing on getting more pay in the

pockets of our lower-salaried workers. Employees making less than $50,000 a year net more funds

from this approach than they would with a 2% cost of living or merit-based increase. Moreover, by

providing the funds in two checks over the course of the year, instead of over 26 pay periods, the

effective buying power of the money will be stronger, sooner.



This performance payment is being funded out of one-time funds available from our fund

balance, which currently has funds in excess of our AA+ bond rating standard of 10% of total budget.

Much of this excess balance has been created over time through the careful savings on the part of

departments and employees, including leaving jobs vacant longer and taking on additional tasks, so it

is fitting that we return a portion of those funds to our employees.



While I believe the combination of the VRS salary offset and the performance payment will go

a long way in terms of addressing the immediate needs of our workforce, I believe some additional

non-monetary incentives are also appropriate. In particular, getting time and space away from a

workplace that demands more and more each year can be beneficial for both the employee and our

workplace productivity. Accordingly, I am proposing that we award our employees with four extra

“personal days” to use – one each quarter, that must be used or lost – so that they can get a much

needed break away from the job site. By having these “personal days”, employees will be able to take a

day off a quarter to deal with personal/family needs (such as completing taxes, attending parent-



Office of Budget and Management Analysis

1 - 11

City of Hampton





MANAGER’S	MESSAGE





teacher conferences, etc.) without having to take away from much-needed vacation time. These

additional days are a one-time extra benefit for having done such an admirable job over the last several

years.



I also propose we give our employees access to health and fitness benefits. Employees have

asked us to consider allowing free use of the community centers and/or providing reduced/free access

to private fitness centers so they can both save money and live healthier lives. This is something I plan

to continue investigating. At a minimum, though, I do believe we should allow our employees’ access

to our community centers, as healthier employees will ultimately reduce our health care expenses.



Last but not least, I have also included funding to restore our tuition assistance program which

was suspended several budget cycles ago. Our employees want to continue to invest in their education

and technical skill set. Our tuition assistance program allows them to do that; and, as they do, we get

an even more skilled and knowledgeable workforce. This investment in our employees will pay many

dividends. I am pleased we were able to find the funds to restore this critical program.



While I know employees would have preferred a recurring salary increase, on top of the VRS

offset, I believe this combination of monetary and non-monetary incentives will demonstrate our

collective appreciation of their continued efforts and dedication.



I would be remiss if I did not note that, even as we go about the process of adopting the FY

2013 budget, staff is already looking ahead to FY 2014 and beyond. We endeavored to make our

balancing decisions fiscally responsible not only for this year but also for the future. I believe we have

honored this need in virtually every recommendation we made. However, we have continued our

limited use of one-time revenues that while prudent now, MAY cause challenges in the future.

Looking ahead, I plan to continue our dialogue with both the School Superintendent and the Newport

News City Manager about potential joint purchasing and/or service delivery opportunities. Already

these conversations offer much promise on enhancing citizen service delivery without adding cost to

an already strained budget. We also continued to explore managed competition, as a way of

demonstrating existing efficiency and value for our customers. While I doubt that there will be savings

to be achieved – indeed, I expect our city departments to be highly competitive in the exploratory bid

process – I am hopeful that by putting our services to the test, we will prove our efficiency and cost

effectiveness, thereby clearly demonstrating the need for future reinvestment in city services.



Nevertheless, as we look forward, we cannot continue to cut our city departments and hold the

line on revenues such as the real estate tax that are declining without adjusting the rate to ensure that

residents at least pay the same in taxes one year to the next. Our citizen engagement efforts show that

the majority of residents understand and support this. I am pleased we were able to avoid such rate

adjustments this year; but, as we look forward, we need to understand that it is not permanently

avoidable.

In closing, as previously stated, this budget required cuts, new ways of doing business and

minor tax/fee increases. I truly believe we have made the rough choices we were called to make in the

least damaging way possible and in a way that is respectful of the resident input. I want to publically

acknowledge and thank a wonderful group of department heads, assistant city managers and budget

team for ensuring that this proposed budget accomplished these goals.



I must also highlight a larger group of employees who two years ago helped me shepherd in a

whole new level of civic engagement around the budget process. This year, that same team enhanced

our “I Value” campaign. Our time in the community has been incredibly uplifting and insightful. To

demonstrate the impact of the citizen comments on this budget in an even more overt way, you will

find that this budget document continues to feature the names, voices and comments of our citizens.

They have helped us to better illustrate for you that this budget is indeed a reflection of community

values. I trust the City Council and the community will enjoy and appreciate these expressions as much

as I do.



We look forward to working with each of you to better understand this budget and its impacts

on our community and workforce in the coming weeks. As always, we stand ready to assist you and

the community in your deliberations.





Sincerely,

Historical Timeline 1570-2012

City of Hampton, Virginia

The City of Hampton is the oldest continuous English-speaking settlement in America. It's history traces back to the Indian village of Kecoughtan, which was visited in 1607 by the first permanent English colonists before they continued up the James River to settle in Jamestown. The following historical timeline highlights just some of the major

milestones and events that have occurred in the City's past up to the present day.

ORGANIZATIONAL	POLICY

FRAMEWORK

The Code of Virginia requires that all local governments in the State formulate and adopt a comprehensive

plan to serve as a general guide for its growth and development. In 1989, the City Council adopted a community

plan which provided a foundation for City policy, planning and budgeting initiatives. The initial plan, the 1998

Strategic Plan, was later updated concurrently with the 2010 Comprehensive Plan and adopted by City Council

on February 6, 2006. The results was a single and integrated Hampton Community Plan (2006, as amended)

which provided a stronger link between the short-term program recommendations of the Strategic Plan and the

long-term, physical recommendations of the Comprehensive Plan. These two plans allowed for a single, more

streamlined and effective community participation process. Approximately every five years, the adopted plan is

reviewed to ensure that it remains relevant and current with respect to community aspirations and challenges.

In October 2010, the City of Hampton in cooperation with the Hampton City Schools, initiated a five year

review of the Hampton Community Plan. The focus of this community-wide review and dialogue was to update

the City’s vision, strategic issues, goals and ways to measure progress. Ten focus groups made up of citizen

volunteers, subject matter experts and staffs were created to formulate ideas and recommendations. The focus

areas included: economic base, education, pride, waterways, housing, government, youth, families, safety and

environment. For several months, the groups worked to redefine the vision and goals for the areas they

represented that led to the final version of this important policy document On October 6, 2011, Community

Plan Update 2011 was unanimously endorsed the by Hampton Planning Commission and by Hampton City Council on November 9, 2011.

BUDGET	POLICIES	AND	PRACTICES



Budget Basis of Accounting

I. Budget Basis of Accounting

a. Modified accrual basis of accounting is used in preparing the budget for governmental

type funds including General Fund, Special Revenue Funds, Capital Projects Fund and

School Fund.

i. Under the modified accrual basis revenues are recognized when they become

both measurable and available to finance the operation of the current year and

expenditures are recorded when the liability is incurred.

1. Revenues prone to accrual consist primarily of property taxes, certain

grants, sales taxes and utility taxes

a. Real and personal property taxes are recorded as revenue when

levied and billed, net of allowances for uncollectible amounts.

i. Property taxes not collected within 45 days after year-end

are reflected as deferred revenue.

2. Revenues from federal, state and other grants are recorded at the time

of receipt of notification of grant.

3. Sales and utility taxes are collected by the State or the utility company,

generally in the month preceding receipt by the City.

ii. Expenditures, other than interest and principal on long-term debt, are

recorded when the liability is incurred.

iii. Interest and principal on long-term debt are recognized when due.

b. Accrual basis of accounting is followed in the Internal Service Funds and Enterprise

Funds.

i. Revenues are recognized when earned and expenses are recognized when the

related liability is incurred.



II.

Financial Accounting

a. Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) shows the status of the City’s

finances on the basis of “generally accepted accounting principles” (GAAP).

i. General Fund and School Operating Funds are legally adopted on a basis

consistent with GAAP.



III.

Budgetary Levels/Controls

a. Annual appropriation ordinance sets the authorized expenditure levels for each

department.

i. Personal Services

ii. Operating Expenses

iii. Capital Outlay

b. Department heads are given total responsibility and accountability for staying within

their Council approved appropriation level.



Office of Budget and Management Analysis

2 - 17

City of Hampton





BUDGET	POLICIES	AND	PRACTICES



i. Departmental budgets are constantly monitored by the department heads, the

budget office and the finance department to ensure that no appropriation is

overspent and that all estimated revenues are realized.

1. Budget to actual expenditure and revenue reports are prepared

quarterly to gauge how the overall budget is tracking.





IV.

Budget Amendments/Transfer Process

a. Adjustments to the adopted budget ordinance may become necessary in order to carry

out planned programs, new Council initiatives and unexpected expenditures.

b. Three types of adjustments:

i. Budget amendment is used to request a transfer of appropriations between

departments within a fund and to increase the budget for a particular fund.

ii. Budget transfer is used to request the transfer of appropriations between line-

items and budgeted categories.

iii. Budget amendments or any revisions that alter the total appropriation

(revenues or expenditures) of a department or fund must be approved by

Council on a quarterly basis.





V.

Budget Savings/Reserves

a. Encumbrances or funds intended to be used for a specific purpose or program that is

not completed by the end of the fiscal year are put into an assigned fund balance

account.

i. Funds are then put into the appropriate department’s new fiscal years’ budget

to finalize the commitment.

b. Unencumbered or unexpended/non-committed appropriations lapse at the end of the

fiscal year.

i. Normally, departments that have unencumbered funds at fiscal year end will

retain 65 percent of these funds. However, due to city-wide budgetary

constraints, these funds have not been returned to the departments for fiscal

years 2008-2011.

ii. Ten percent is put into an innovations pool to fund technological needs for

collaborative projects between departments.

iii. The remaining funds are split between the City’s drainage program

(approximately $500,000) and committed fund balance account commonly

called budget savings.

BUDGET	POLICIES	AND	PRACTICES



VI.

Fund Balance Classification

The Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB), an independent organization

that establishes and improves standards of accounting and financial reporting for U.S.

state and local governments, issued a standard on fund balance classifications that the

City is required to apply to the fiscal year 2011 (CAFR). The standard is GASB Statement

Number 54, "Fund Balance Reporting and Governmental Fund Type Definitions”. The

purpose of this statement is to improve comparability, increase transparency and improve

the usefulness of governmental fund balance information.



The implementation of GASB Number 54 will not impact the FY12 Council Approved

Budget. The purpose of this policy is to set forth the different classifications of fund

balance and the level of authority required to assign or commit these funds. On July 13,

2011, GASB 54 will be presented to City Council for adoption.



An accounting distinction is made between the portions of fund balance that is spendable

and non-spendable.

a. The Hampton City Council has the authority to set aside funds for a specific purpose.

Any funds set aside as Committed Fund Balance requires the passage of a resolution.

The passage of the resolution must take place prior to the end of the applicable fiscal

year. If the actual amount of the commitment is not available by the end of the fiscal

year, the resolution must state the process or formula to calculate the actual amount

as soon as information is available. Commitments may be changed or lifted only by

the City Council taking the same formal action that imposed the constraint originally.

b. Assigned Fund Balance consists of amounts that are intended to be used by the City

for a specific purpose that is neither restricted nor committed. The intent should be

expressed by the governing body itself or an official such as the City Manger that the

governing body has delegated the authority to assign amounts to be used for specific

purposes. Assigned Fund Balance differs from Committed Fund Balance in that

assignments do not require a resolution.

c. Unassigned Fund Balance (formerly undesignated fund balance) is the amount of

fund balance in the General Fund which cannot be classified as nonspendable,

restricted, committed or assigned. It represents funds available for immediate

appropriation. The City’s Financial Policy states the City will maintain an

Unassigned Fund Balance equal to 10% of total General Fund and School Operating

Fund revenues.

d. Nonspendable Fund Balance includes items where the cash will not be realized in the

next year. Examples would be inventory, long-term receivable, or a fund that is

legally or contractually required to be maintained intact such as a permanent fund.

e. Restricted Fund Balance is where the constraints placed on these funds are either

externally imposed by creditors, grantors, laws or regulations of other governments or

they are imposed by law through constitutional provisions or enabling legislation.

DESCRIPTION	OF

BUDGETED	FUNDS





The descriptions below explain the purpose of each of the funds listed in the “Summary of

Budgeted Funds” pages.

GOVERNMENTAL-TYPE FUNDS



The City’s adopted budget contains appropriations for four major and nine non-major

governmental-type funds. The General Fund, Capital Improvement Fund, Debt Service Fund,

and the Economic Development Fund are all considered major governmental funds. Of the nine

non-major governmental funds, only four are appropriated and presented in this budget:

Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), Stormwater Management and the two

Community Development Authorities, namely the Peninsula Town Center and the H20 which

are presented in the Contributions to Outside Agencies tab. The modified accrual basis is used

to budget all governmental-type funds.



General Fund

The General Fund accounts for all revenues and expenditures that are not required to be

accounted for in a special purpose fund. This Funds’ revenue source are taxes and fees

generated at the local level, such as real estate, personal property, utility taxes, etc. The

General Fund finances most of the regular day-to-day operations of the City. The following

descriptions refer to the individual General Fund appropriations transfers to other funds within

the City.



 Transfer to Capital Improvement Fund is a fund that accounts for financial

resources to be used for the acquisition or major construction of capital assets

such as land, buildings, parks, streets and roads. In order for expenditures to be

eligible for the capital budget, they must cost over $50,000 and have a life

expectancy of five or more years.



 Debt Service Fund is a fund that accounts for the accumulation of resources for and

the payment of general long-term debt principal and interest of the City. Primary

resources of the Debt Service Fund are derived from transfers from the General

Fund and the proceeds from the refinancing of existing bonds.

DESCRIPTION	OF

BUDGETED	FUNDS





 School Operations Fund is a special revenue fund which is the depository for

specifically identified revenues received from the Commonwealth of Virginia for

schools which are then transferred to the School Operating Fund; in addition to

the expensing of the City’s local match to the schools.



 Retirement and Employee Benefits are where the City’s budgeted fiduciary

obligations/activities are reported within the Retirement and Benefits section of

this budget document. The City excludes these activities from the City’s

government-wide statements because the City cannot use these assets to finance

its operations. The City is the trustee, or fiduciary for its employees’ pension

plans: Hampton Employees Retirement System (HERS) and the Virginia

Supplemental Retirement System (VRS).



 Transfers to Other Funds facilitate inter-fund transfers in order to support the

functions to be carried out by the receiving fund. General Fund transfers to other

funds may be made for operating as well as capital purposes.



Special Revenue Funds

Revenues in this fund are restricted for a specific purpose. Examples of special revenue funds

are Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Fund and the Economic Development Fund.



 Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Fund is the depository for the funds that

are awarded to the City annually from the Department of Housing and Urban

Development. CDBG funds are used to complement other resources in the

implementation of the Healthy Neighborhoods Initiative.



 Economic Development Fund was established as a depository to fund public

improvement projects or purchases and acquisition of land in support of economic

development efforts, the revenue source of which is to be derived primarily from land

sales and rents.

BUDGETED	FUNDS





PROPRIETARY-TYPE FUNDS



The departments within these Funds are accounted for on a similar basis as a private business.

The City maintains two types of propriety funds; Internal Service and Enterprise Funds. These

funds are budgeted using the full accrual basis for budgeting.



Internal Service Funds

These funds are used to account for the financing of goods or services provided by one

department or agency to other departments or agencies of the City, on a cost reimbursement

basis. The Internal Service Fund departments include Fleet Management, Information

Technology, and Risk Management.



 Fleet Management Fund accounts for the operations of the City’s central automotive

maintenance and major vehicle service facility.

 Information Technology Fund accounts for the costs of providing the following services:

computer technical support, internet and telecommunications services.

 Risk Management Fund accounts for the costs of providing insurance coverage and

certain self-insured liabilities of the City and the School Board.



Enterprise Funds

Enterprise Funds operate in a manner similar to private businesses in which operating

expenses are completely or partially recovered from income collected from user fees charged to

the general public. The Hampton Roads Convention Center, The Hamptons Golf Course, and

the Wastewater Management Fund are considered major Enterprise Funds. The non-major

funds are the Coliseum, Woodland Road Golf Course, Solid Waste Fund, and the Steam Plant.

For presentation purposes, the Solid Waste, Steam Plant, and the Wastewater funds are

presented under the “Public Works Funds” section of this document.



 Hampton Coliseum Fund accounts for revenues generated and expenses associated

with shows, meetings, civic/community events and other activities provided by the

Coliseum.

FINANCIAL	POLICIES





General Fund

The City Council adopted a set of financial parameters to guide future City expenditure patterns.

These financial policies and their compliance with the approved budget are outlined in this section.



City Tax Revenue Guideline

City Council approved a guideline for budget development in which real estate tax revenue growth

(net of new construction) from one fiscal year to the next shall be limited to the equivalent

percentage increase of an inflationary growth factor as measured by either the consumer price

index for urban dwellers (CPI-U) or resident income growth (RI); whichever is greater in any given

year. To the extent that budgetary needs require real estate revenues to grow faster than this

factor, the Manager and Council shall explicitly explain the budget driving factors causing this so

that residents may have a concise and clear understanding of the need to deviate from this

financial guideline.



For FY 2013, the real estate assessment growth is expected to decline an average 4.5%. This

decline is below the guidelines established by City Council and therefore, the guideline stated

above was not applied to the Fiscal Year 2013 Budget.



City Financial Policy

In April 2007, the City Council amended its existing financial policies. The financial policies relate

to general operating elements of the City. These policies are used as financial planning parameters

during the annual budget process. The five (5) financial polices and the actual results are

summarized below. The City’s FY13 Council Approved Budget is in compliance with all five

policies.



1. Debt Limit Policy #1. This policy is comprised of three guidelines as outlined below:

(a) General obligation debt shall not exceed 3% of the assessed value of all real estate within

the City subject to taxation. The legal debt limit authorized by the Virginia State Statute

limits bond issuing authority up to 10% of the assessed value. The FY13 estimated

general obligation debt will total $285 million or 2.7% of taxable real estate value

($10,485,644,327), which is within the policy parameter.

(b) General obligation bonded debt together with indirect debt, which includes certain

revenue backed debt and subject-to-appropriation or moral obligation commitments, and

debt of certain special purpose entities (i.e. Community Development Authority) shall not

exceed 4.5% or $515.8 million of the estimated FY13 assessed value of all real and

personal property subject to taxation within the City. The current level of net

direct/indirect/overlapping debt is $477.4 million or 4.2% of the assessed value of all

taxable real and personal property which is within the policy parameter.

(c) Debt of certain special purpose entities, such as community development authorities, shall

not exceed 1% of the assessed value of all real and personal property subject to taxation

within the City. The expected amount is $101.8 million or 0.9% of the approximate FY13

assessed value of all taxable real and personal property, which is within the policy

parameter.

2. Debt Service Limit Policy #2. General obligation bonded debt and indirect debt shall not

exceed 10% or $44.1 million of the City’s total General Fund, School Operating Fund and

Convention Center expenditures of which all are included in the City’s total debt service. The

total annual debt service cost equals $38.1 million or 8.6% of total expenditures, which is

within the policy parameter.

3. Debt Retirement Policy #3. The City shall retire 60% of the principal balance of general

bonded obligation debt within 10 years of the date the debt is issued. The City will retire

approximately $197.3 million or 69.2% of general bonded obligation debt within the next 10

years.

4. Equity Funding Policy #4. This policy is comprised of two guidelines as outlined below:

(a) A minimum of 2% to 6% of general fund revenues will be applied to Capital Improvement

Plan (CIP) projects each year. For FY13, the percentage of revenues utilized for capital

expenditures are estimated to be $10.9 million which is 3.6% of General Fund revenues.

(b) A minimum of 10% to 15% of CIP projects over a rolling five-year period are to be funded

from general fund revenues. For the five year period, FY13 through FY17, the City plans

to use an estimated $55.5 million or 56.3% of General Fund revenues on CIP projects.

5. Unassigned Fund Balance Policy #5. The City will maintain an unassigned General Fund

balance equal to 10% of total General Fund and School Operating Fund revenues less School

transfers. To the extent unassigned fund balance falls below the policy, the shortfall shall be

replenished over a three-year period. For FY13, the estimated revenues are projected to total

$425.4 million; ten percent or $42.5 million is the minimum required balance. The

unassigned fund balance at June 30, 2012 is forecasted to be $55.7 million of which $4.0

million will be utilized for one-time operating expenditures and the capital budget in fiscal

year 2013. The remaining unassigned fund balance will be $51.7 million will be in excess of

policy by $9.2 million at 12.2%.



The City is in compliance with the Financial Policy Guidelines.



CREDIT RATINGS

The City’s credit ratings are as follows: AA+ by Standard and Poor’s, Aa1 by Moody’s Investor

Services and AA+ by Fitch Rating. A credit rating is a financial indicator to the public/investor as

to the credit worthiness (quality) of a debt issue such as bonds. See Debt Management Policies, for

further details.

These collections are the results of charges ordered by the courts for violations of City ordinances. These

revenues are expected to have an increase from $1,946,000 to $2,132,000 for FY13 due mostly to a rate

change, from $5 to $10 per case, for Sheriff’s Court Security. Funds received from this function are to be

expended in the Sheriff’s budget for court security.





Revenues from Use of Money & Property

Category

(Decrease)

Explanation

Constitutional, Judicial

$ 23,460

The overall increase is attributed to the additional

Election. This increase is offset by the elimination of

one full-time position and savings from a recent

retirement.

(134,116)



The overall net decrease is mainly attributed to the

Neighborhoods

reduction of two full-time positions within the Real

Estate

Assessor

and

Community

departments. In addition, funds are being reduced for

various consultant fees. Also, included in the

recommended budget is the reengineering of Land

Development Services to improve customer service

functions which will be partially supported with a

new technology fee.

Infrastructure

(313,123)

The

overall net decrease is attributable to the



realignment of two full-time positions to the two Golf

Courses, and various transfers of allocable positions to

Fleet Services and Stormwater Fund. Also included is

the elimination of the window cleaning contract and the

centralization of utility costs from the Teen Center to

Public Works - Facilities.

savings from a retirement; reduced lease costs and

reduction in library materials.

Public Safety

166,569

The overall net increase is attributable to fixed cost

increases offset by the elimination of one full-time

PURPOSE	OF	DEPARTMENTAL

				BUSINESS	TEAMS





The City of Hampton has seven business teams: Constitutional, Judicial and Electoral Offices;

FY12 Manager’s

Economic Vitality and Neighborhoods; Infrastructure; Leisure Services; Public Safety; Quality

Recommended Budget

Government; and Youth and Families that are facilitated by the City Manager and the

Assistant City Managers to achieve an interconnectedness that is critical in today’s operating

environment. The business teams focus the City’s organization on the initiatives selected by

their elected and appointed leaders. Many departments contribute to more than one business

area.

Business team management enhances financial control and long-range planning by requiring

that all departments focus not only on their individual needs but also on the needs of the

business unit as well. The teams are expected to develop annual and long-range goals; integrate

departmental plans to key business unit plans; share resources across departmental lines as

necessary; eliminate disparity in the application of organizational policies; and most of all,

make a positive and substantial contribution to the attainment of the City’s mission statement

– to be the most livable city in Virginia.

Increasing demands for services with dwindling local, state and federal revenues compel us to

tighten financial and operational control in the organization. The clustering of departments into

key business units accomplishes that goal. More importantly, however, business team

management allows us to be better prepared for future challenges. No one department acting in

isolation can prepare our citizens or community for these challenges – it takes a strong,

coordinated and integrated effort on the part of multiple departments and outside entities to

achieve what our community will need in the future.

The City Manager and staff continue their commitment to present the budget according to key

business team areas.

maintain my property and meet

my other financial obligations.

The Treasurer’s Office has worked

with me with compassion and

understanding to let me pay

my taxes on payment plans

to allow me to keep my home

and maintain a sense of dignity.

Without them I would have lost

“We noticed serious back yard

flooding outside of our fence line

after a heavy downpour. After

contacting Public Works, the

crew came out for an assessment

and the next day cleaned leaves

and debris out of the drainage

area. They also chopped large

tree roots and even laid down

new cement drainage pathway.

The crews were very friendly

and professional in the way

they went about their business.”

“I have always wanted to

draw and in 2011 I finally did

something about it. I started

with a drawing class . . . at The

and have enjoyed it so much.

My husband Bob and I also

thoroughly enjoy the wonderful

variety and excellence of

performances at The American

Theatre. Hampton Arts is such

a valuable community resource

for Hampton’s citizens and

an attraction for visitors from

Our goal is to reduce the occurrence of violent crimes within the City of Hampton by 2.5% and increase the clearance rate by 2% over the next two years. Increase the number of narcotic and weapon law violation investigations within the City of Hampton by 3.5% and increase the clearance rate by 4% over the next two years. The personnel assigned to Investigations identify and interview witnesses and suspects, collect evidence, arrest offenders and assist with criminal prosecutions. Taking violent and career offenders out of the community allows the City of Hampton to maintain one of the lowest crime rates in the region. Investigations currently maintain a case clearance rate equal to or better than surrounding jurisdictions for both persons and property related crimes.

“My job is extremely important.

The decisions we make in

the first few minutes after

receiving a 911 call can mean

the difference between life and

death. In November 2011, I

assisted a cab driver that was

being threatened. He called

back to compliment me for

how quickly we dispatched

officers to him and for being so

professional.”

– Deirdre Brown





STRATEGIC	CUSTOMER	SERVICE

911	‐	311

This department is comprised of two call centers - the Emergency Communications Center (911), and the

Customer Call Center (311). The Emergency Communications Center is the critical component in emergency

services, receiving and dispatching police, fire, emergency medical services and animal control. The 311

Customer Call Center provides easy, convenient access to non-emergency city information and city services

using a single, easy to remember phone number (3-1-1) with a customer service level that is unparalleled in

the business.

The total budget for this department is $2,912,907 which funds the following services in these approximate amounts: FY 13

FY 13

Budget

Positions

911 Emergency Communications Center

$ 1,998,477

50.0

Provide customers with accurate, timely information regarding emergency disasters and unusual or severe weather events. By using the one easy to remember number, customers already are conditioned to contact the call center during emergency events.

Call center staff directly support the Emergency Operations Center by monitoring trends and rumors of an event and therefore provide customers with the most accurate information available. The call center tests our business continuity plan bi-annually and participates in all EOC table top exercises. The call center will provide support to the EOC during activations and/or exercises and provide accurate, timely information to our customers even if a disruption of phone service occurs.

Public Safety Information Center

$ 225,385

7.0

To provide police support services to the citizens of Hampton, 24 hours per day 365 days per year. These services include receipt of citizen crime reports via telephone and documentation of offenses in the incident based reporting system. Provide support to officers in the field by accessing national and state crime information systems, entering stolen vehicles and missing persons and other non-emergency activities from patrol such as phone calls and contacting other law enforcement agencies.

311 Call Center ~ Customer Assistance

$ 431,333

10.0

Provide easy, convenient access to city information and services using a single, easy-to-remember phone number (3-1-1), 24

hours a day, 7 days a week, providing service beyond customer’s expectation. Citizens find that “just one call does it all,” with knowledgeable staff whose goal is to delight the customer. The Call Center uses a customer focused approach and with a cross-trained staff, the Call Center provides citizens with a “just one call – does it all” access to local government services and information. Satisfaction is based on number of calls handled on a daily/monthly/yearly basis, call wait-time, call talk time, abandon rate, number of services processed vs. informational calls and citizen’s reporting very-good to excellent service from call center staff. Service goal is to reduce call wait-times to under 60 seconds and to increase our “very-good to excellent”

survey results from 93% to 94%. This will decrease the on-hold time reaching an advocate and increase customer satisfaction.

CONTINGENCY

The mission of the Contingency's account is to provide a reserve that funds unanticipated and/or emergency

expenditures which occur during the course of a fiscal year. Contingency is also utilized to cover any shortfalls that occur during the year due to loss of revenues. Contingency funds are transferred to various City departments or projects when the need arises. Funds have also been set aside due to unanticipated declines in State revenues once the Governor's budget is approved.

The total budget for this function is $1,134,619.

FY 13

Budget

Emergency Reserve Account

1,134,619

$

By nature, it is difficult to predict in advance how these monies will be used since it is included for unanticipated requirements.

In prior years, uses have included supplemental funding for jails, equipment purchases for courts and other City/State offices, legal fees and unexpected revenue shortfalls. Contingency is funded at less than one-half percent of the City's budget excluding School funding. It is standard practice for contingencies to be funded at two to four percent of the budget. There are no actual expenditures for FY09-FY11 because contingency funds are transferred to other departments where the actual expenditure has occurred.

program.

“I recently successfully completed

my obligations to the Hampton

Court Service Unit. Years ago,

when I was younger, I was not

compliant with the expectations

of my mother and had negative

involvements both in the home

and the community. I learned

a valuable lesson from these

experiences, and much of this

is attributed to the services and

assistance that were provided by

the Hampton Court Services.”

HAMPTON	HEALTH	DEPARTMENT

The mission of the Hampton Health Department is to promote, protect and preserve the health of the citizens of

Hampton. This is achieved by a multi-disciplinary team of medical and environmental specialists working

together toward the prevention of disease and disability.

The total City's share of the Hampton Health Department's budget is $1,439,960, which funds the following

services in these approximate amounts:

FY 13

Budget

Leadership & Management

$ 486,587

Provide managerial oversight, set goals, objectives and strategies and provide administration to ensure the effective and efficient delivery of public health services. Provide support services to the department including financial management, personnel management, management of vital records and facilities maintenance/management.

Maternal & Child Health

$ 92,350

Provide salaries for two health department employees who work full-time in Hampton’s Healthy Start home visiting program.

These positions are the director of the program and a senior social worker. We are focusing on issues around infant mortality in the community through patient contact and education.

Immunization Services

$ 88,777

Operate Immunization Clinic to prevent vaccine-preventable diseases in infants, children and adolescents by the administration of required children’s immunizations. The Health Department is required by state code to provide these services regardless of family income. Prevent or ameliorate influenza and its complications by the administration of the flu vaccine. The Influenza vaccine is recommended, but not required. However, it is a fundamental public health preventive measure which the Virginia Department of Health requires all health departments to provide.

Family Planning

$ 221,781

Operate a Women’s Specialty Clinic providing comprehensive health services including annual gynecological checkups, medical care for gynecological problems, family planning services and pregnancy counseling and testing. Improve the health of women and babies by offering contraceptive methods which will allow a woman to become pregnant when she is ready and most able to do so.

Family planning services are not required by code but are a fundamental public health measure which the Virginia Department of Health requires all health departments to provide. Funding for this service comes from a federal Title X grant, which operates on a sliding scale. Income A patients pay nothing. The Health Department is increasing the number of women enrolled in Plan First, a Medicaid program which pays for family planning services.

Environmental Health

$ 133,392

Provide environmental health services to protect Hampton Residents. Routinely inspect 100% of all regulated food establishments at least three times per year and groceries at least twice per year. Food services inspections are required by state and city code.

Properly confine 95% of all domestic animals involved in potential rabies exposures within 24 hours of exposure report. Rabies control is required by state code. Routinely inspect 100% of all body art establishments at least quarterly. This service is required by city code. Routinely sample water from at least five sites along the Chesapeake Bay identified as recreational beach areas, test those samples for bacterial contamination and report results to city officials. This service is not required but is good public health practice. It also demonstrates to watchdog organizations which monitor beach pollution, such as the National Resources Defense Council, that Hampton’s beaches are safe.

“I value my family above all

things. The people at the CSA

office recognize this. They

provide me with the help I

need to raise my two grandsons.

They have special needs and

without the CSA, the boys could

very well end up in foster care,

residential treatment facilities or

jail.”

HUMAN	SERVICES	~

Comprehensive	Service	Act

The Comprehensive Services Act for At-Risk Youth and Families requires that locally coordinated

services be provided to families whose children are at high risk of out-of-home placement. The

approach allows agencies to focus their combined efforts on the total needs of families instead of being

driven by the agencies' different administrative structures and regulations. This budget covers the

local required match for service delivery to these families.

The total budget is $1,974,095, which funds the following service:

Local Match

$ 1,974,095

To provide local funding as the match to State funding for servicing families of at-risk youth, who are at a high risk of out-of-home placement.

Total FY13 Budget





$ 1,974,095

Note: Funds that were formerly allocated to individual departments are now allocated to the City in

one block grant that is jointly administered by the departments of Health, Human Services, the

Community Services Board, Juvenile Court Services, the School Board, a private provider and a

parent representative. Examples of these purchased services are foster care, residential special

education placements and placements made by the Juvenile Court

“When I had no means of

providing for my 2-year-old

daughter and myself, Hampton

showed me how I could. My

case worker was so kind and

helped me through one of the

most difficult times in my

life. She led me to available

resources and educational

opportunities at Healthy

up, just when I needed it, saved

both our lives and we will be

forever grateful to the City of

RETIREMENT	AND

	BENEFITS	DESCRIPTIONS



Accrued Payroll

The City pays its employees on a bi-weekly basis during the fiscal year which begins July 1st

and ends June 30th. For General Fund departments, any pay days within the first pay period of

the fiscal year that relate to the month of June is (accrued) charged back to the closing fiscal

year. The total amount accrued is charged against this accrued payroll account instead of the

individual departments’ salary expense line-item. This satisfies the principles of the modified

accrual basis of accounting that the City uses.



Compensation: Pay and Minimum Wage Adjustments and Sustained

Performance Program

The City appropriates monies for mid-year promotions and position upgrades in order to retain

successful employees and stay in-line with comparable market ranges. This budget line-item is

also the funding source for federally imposed minimum wage adjustments and the City’s

Sustained Performance Program for Master Officer, Senior Police Officers, etc. For FY 2013,

an employee performance bonus payment is included in the Council Approved Budget

contingent upon performance ratings based on the eligible employee’s annual performance

review.





Hampton Employees Retirement System (HERS) Contribution

HERS is a City provided retirement plan that was designed to supplement the retirement of

those City employees eligible for participation in the Virginia Supplemental Retirement System

(VRS). HERS covers all full-time salaried employees who were first hired prior to July 1, 1984.

The City is required to contribute an actuarially determined rate which currently is 57.07% of

the annual covered payroll. For FY13, the budget for HERS will increase by $1,055,000.



Hospitalization Insurance (Self Insured)

Currently, the City offers one medical plan, Anthem Blue Cross/Blue Shield KeyCare (PPO

plan) to all eligible employees and active and qualified retired employees. For FY13,

approximately 82% of eligible City employees will participate in the plan. This plan is

supported by the City and its subscribers. For active employees, the City’s premium portion

averages approximately 71% and the employee’s share averages approximately 29% depending

on the type of employee coverage. The estimated increase in premiums is expected to be 9%

which will be applied to both the City and employee’s share. The City also offers a vision and

dental plan to its eligible employees; however all premiums are paid in full by the enrollee

through payroll deductions. The City of Hampton does not budget funds for these plans.





Office of Budget and Management Analysis 13 - 1 City of Hampton





RETIREMENT	AND

	BENEFITS	DESCRIPTIONS



Life Insurance

All eligible permanent full-time employees are automatically covered under the basic group life

insurance program provided by Minnesota Life for VRS members and retirees. The premium

costs are calculated as a percentage of the employee’s annual salary. Effective July 1, 2012, the

group life insurance rates will increase from 0.28% to 0.53% as approved by the Virginia

Governor and General Assembly. The City pays the entire life insurance premiums of 0.53% for

all eligible employees/retirees.





Other Fringe Benefits

This budget represents miscellaneous fringe benefits such as deferred compensation as a part of

the City Attorney, City Manager and Municipal Clerk’s compensation package.





Workmen’s Compensation (Self Insured)

The City is exposed to various risks of loss related to torts; theft of, damages to and destruction

of assets; error and omissions; injuries to employees and natural disasters. The City has an

established Risk Management Fund (Internal Service Fund) to account for and finance its

uninsured risk of loss and the cost of providing insurance coverage such as automobile, general

liability and workmen’s compensation. Since the City is self-insured, this appropriation is

essentially a General Fund transfer to the Risk Management Fund to support this self-insured

liability of the City. For FY13, the Workmen’s Compensation will increase by $187,027 over

FY12.



Separation Leave Pay

Employees who retire or separate from employment with the City are entitled to receive

payment for unused sick and vacation leave. According to the City’s Personnel Policies Manual,

active employees who are eligible for separation benefits have an established maximum number

of hours that can be paid out. Upon separation, other than retirement pay, employees will

receive sick leave pay of $20 per day up to a maximum of 720 hours. For retirees, sick leave is

paid up to 720 hours based on an hourly rate equivalent to one-half of the employee’s annual

salary. For both separating and retiring employees, vacation leave pay will be based on the

employees hourly rate on the date of separation up to the maximum accrual payout set forth in

the Personnel Policies Manual.

RETIREMENT	AND

	BENEFITS	DESCRIPTIONS





Social Security (FICA)

This is the employer portion of the Medicare tax obligations for all paid employees.

Contributions are calculated utilizing a combined rate for Social Security and Medicare (7.65%)

applied to a predetermined wage base. For FY13, the FICA will increase as a result of a six-

percent increase in base salaries.





Unemployment Insurance

The City pays unemployment tax on the first $8,000 of wages earned for each employee during

a calendar year. The percentage rate applied is computed by the Virginia Department of

Taxation. The City is estimated to pay approximately $240,000 in unemployment taxes for

Fiscal Year 2013.





Virginia Retirement System (VRS) Contribution

The City of Hampton contributes to the VRS, an agent and cost-sharing multiple-employer

defined benefit pension plan administered by the Virginia Retirement System. All full-time,

salaried employees of the City must participate in the VRS Plan. Members are required by Title

51.1 of the Code of Virginia (1950), as amended, to contribute 5% of their annual reported

compensation to VRS. In the past, the City of Hampton has assumed the 5% member

contribution in addition to its 18.57% required payment based on an actuarial basis specified by

the Code of Virginia and approved by the VRS Board of Trustees. Based on new legislation as

currently mandated by the General Assembly, local governments are required to offset the

increased 5% member contribution by a 5% salary increase beginning July 1, 2012. Funding

totaling $3.77 million (equivalent to 6% salary increase) has been set aside to insure that the

majority of City of Hampton employees are covered for the additional cost. The net additional

funding will cost the City $1.7 million.





Voluntary Retirement Incentive Program

As part of the FY2013 budget development process, the City once again offered City of Hampton

employees the Voluntary Retirement Incentive Program in order to redirect budget resources

amid the economic decline. This is a voluntary retirement incentive program which offered

financial incentives to city employees (employed by the City of Hampton on or before February

1, 2012) who were eligible for either reduced or unreduced retirement under the Virginia

Retirement System (based on age and years of service). The incentive offered a one-time

payment equal to 20% of the employee’s base annual salary. Eligibility was contingent upon the

employee retiring no later than July 1, 2012.

Line of Duty Pay

According to the Virginia Code 9.1-400, the Line of Duty Pay (LODA) applies to any first

responder or public safety employee who dies or becomes disabled in the line of duty. The plan,

which is a component of the Virginia Retirement System, will provide death benefits and

continued health insurance coverage to disabled person, their spouses, dependents and

surviving spouse and dependents of deceased law-enforcement officers and firefighters. VRS

has created a fund for payment of the program benefits. The City is mandated by the State to

make contributions to this plan on behalf of its public safety employees. This category has been

increased by $180,000 to provide for adherence to plan requirements for FY13.



Office of Budget and Management Analysis 13 - 4 City of Hampton





RETIREMENT	AND	BENEFITS

The Retirement and Employee Benefits appropriation covers the City's share of employee benefits costs

including VRS retirement, life insurance, FICA (social security), workmen's compensation, separation pay,

unemployment fees and health insurance. Costs involved in compensating employees, such as merit pay,

specialized incentive pay and pay increases for Constitutional Officers are budgeted here as well.

*EERP - Early Retiree Reinsurance Program

Budget Note: This budget reflects the following changes:

• City's share of a 9% health insurance premium increase which will be shared equitably with employees;

• An increase in HERS in accordance with actuarial requirements;

• An increase in VRS ~ Group Life Insurance premiums;

• An increase in Line of Duty funding;

• Funding for a performance payment for full-time and part-time employees, contingent upon a

performance rating based on the employee's annual performance review; and

• The General Assembly has decided that employees must pay the 5% employee share of their VRS contributions starting in FY13. The General Assembly is also proposing the City to provide a 5% salary increase to partially offset the impact of this change. This new shift would require employees to pay additional FICA taxes, to

compensate for this increase the City has decided to increase all current VRS eligible employees’ pay by 6% to ensure that employees take home the same level of pay.

Change

Explanation

Constitutional, Judicial and Electoral

position

was

approved.

During

the

FY13

budget

deliberations, a vacant clerical position is recommended for

elimination.

Economic Vitality and Neighborhoods

Assessor of Real Estate

(1.0)

This decrease is due to the elimination of one vacant

professional position due to a retirement.

Community Development

(2.0)

This net decrease is due to the transfer of one professional

position to PW-Engineering during fiscal year 2012, in

addition to eliminating one technical position. As a result of

the reorganization of Land Development Services, sixteen

positions will be eliminated and sixteen new positions will

be created. For details, please see the Manager's Message

and the Community Development Department under the

"Economic Vitality and Neighborhoods" tab of this

document.

position from Recreation Division; a mechanic position to

Fleet Services and two technical positions to The Hamptons

and The Woodlands Golf Courses, respectively.

(1.0)

This decrease is a result of the transfer of one managerial

position to PW-Engineering during the fiscal year 2012.

EXPLANATION	OF	MAJOR

INCREASES	AND	DECREASES	FOR

FISCAL	YEAR	2013





Tax Based Contributions

Coliseum Central BID & Downtown BID – ($51,943): This decrease represents a reduction in

assessments for the City's and BID's share of the self-imposed assessment for various capital

improvements.



H20 Community Development Authorities & Peninsula Town Center (CDAs) –

($1,235,886): The CDA is a legal requirement with funding to be reflected in the City’s budget. The

FY13 figures are estimates and only what is collected will paid out. The CDAs are offset by

revenues on the revenue side of the budget.

Peninsula Town Center CDA Incremental Taxes - $149,148: This amount represents payment

of the incremental taxes collected at the Peninsula Town Center





Organizational Support

Arts Foundation - $50,000: These funds were previously budgeted in the Arts Commission

budget. Due to the retirement of the Executive Director, a portion of the funds for the vacant

position were moved into Operating Expenses and the remainder placed in Organizational Support

for the Foundation to contract out a Director for the Commission.



Bay Days – ($30,000): The City will now be providing festival management oversight to Bay

Days therefore reducing the City’s support to the festival.



Hampton Roads Transit - $228,473: In FY12 the City chose to use $190,176 in true-up savings

from FY10 to decrease HRT’s FY12 allocation thus bringing the true increase for FY13 to $38,297.

The funding increase is due to fuel increases, union contracts and loss of State revenue.



Hampton Roads Regional Jail - $63,925: The increase in the payments to the HRRJ is due to an

increase in the per diem rate.

Home Elevation Revolving Loan Program: ($2,500,000): One-time funding in FY12 was used

for seed funds to implement a Home Revolving Loan Program. Repayment of the loans will be

placed back into the program.



Sister Cities – ($5,000): The non-profit submitted a $5,000 reduction in their FY13 budget

request.

DEBT	MANAGEMENT	POLICIES



The City maintains a separate Debt Service Fund that tracks long-term debt obligated for General

Fund activities. Debt activity for Enterprise, Internal Service, Special Revenue and Public Works

Funds are maintained in those individual funds. The Debt Service Fund accounts for the

accumulation of resources (monies) for and the payment of general obligation debt of the City.

Primary resources of the Debt Service Fund are derived from transfers from the General Fund and

the proceeds of any refunding bond issues.



The City borrows money by issuing bonds or notes. According to the City Code, bonds and notes in

anticipation of bonds may be issued for the purposes authorized by Council. The City issues this

debt in order to fund (pay for) projects within its Capital Improvement Program.



There are several reasons why the City may choose to borrow money: to fund current and future

needs; share the cost of a project with those utilizing the facility (project) in the future and to avoid

excessive cost burden on current taxpayers.



The City sometimes uses short-term obligations (e.g. Bond Anticipation Notes, Capital Leases, and

Line of Credit) to bridge the time gap between initiation of a project/purchase and the anticipated

bond issuance, when the nature of a purchase precludes the issuance of long-term debt, or when it is

fiscally responsible to do so. Prior to the issuance of any short or long-term obligations, the City

considers the effect on their financial position, the ability to repay, and the Commonwealth of

Virginia imposed legal debt limit.



Each fiscal year, the City of Hampton supports the acquisition, construction, renovation and

infrastructure maintenance stated in its five-year adopted Capital Improvement Plan. The capital

projects are funded from pay-as-you-go current revenues (general operating revenues), federal and

state revenues, appropriation from fund balance and the issuance of general obligation bonds. The

CIP provides a foundation to plan and structure debt in advance. The repayment period of the debt

should not exceed the expected useful life of the capital project for which the debt is incurred. In

doing so, specific sources are identified and dedicated to the retirement of debt. On April 11, 2007,

the City adopted a financial policy regarding the minimum amount of general fund revenues that

can be used to fund the CIP each year and over a rolling 5-year period. Each fiscal year the capital

budget, which represents the first year of the five year CIP, is adopted as a part of the overall City’s

Council Approved Budget.



The FY13 Council Approved Budget proposes a bond issue for $46,862,500. The total proceeds will

fund City capital projects and the Hampton City Schools maintenance projects. The Hampton City

Schools’ will continue to contribute $2,000,000 to pay for part of the debt service attributed to the

school major renovation and maintenance projects.



The City’s credit ratings are as follows: AA+ by Standard and Poor’s, Aa2 by Moody’s Investor

Services and AA by Fitch Rating. A credit rating is a financial indicator to the public/investor as to

the credit worthiness (quality) of a debt issue such as bonds. These agencies evaluate the City’s

credit risk based on the following areas: record of debt payments on time, consistent and strong

revenue growth; diverse, balanced revenue streams, reasonable, controlled expenditures, level of

liquid reserves (including fund balance) and strong financial planning. The highest credit ratings

DEBT	MANAGEMENT	POLICIES

are Aaa (Moody), AA+ (Fitch) and AAA (Standard & Poor’s). Both agencies have intermediate

ratings and default ratings of Ca, C (Moody) and D (Standard & Poor’s). The bonds with default

ratings are more likely unable to repayment of the debt.



Office of Budget and Management Analysis 15 - 2

City of Hampton





DEBT	SERVICE	REQUIREMENTS





This section contains information on the City’s debt service requirement for the next five years.

Debt service is similar to a mortgage; the City borrows funds by selling bonds and agrees to pay

the money back to the purchasers of those bonds over a 20 to 30 year period. These funds

received by the City are used for the acquisition, construction and renovation of public facilities

and infrastructure as well as major equipment purchases.

The rate of interest paid for borrowing these funds is determined by credit ratings from rating

agencies such as Standard and Poor’s, Moody’s Investor Service and Fitch Rating. The City’s

credit worthiness is rated similar to the credit ratings of an average citizen. The better the

score, the lower the interest rate charged on borrowing. The highest credit ratings are Aaa

(Moody) and AAA (Standard & Poor’s).

The City ensures that it does not borrow more than it can afford by adopting a set of financial

policies. For debt services the following policies apply:

 General obligation debt shall not exceed 3% of the assessed value of all real

estate within the City subject to taxation.

 General obligation bonded debt together with indirect debt, which includes

certain revenue backed debt and subject to appropriation or moral obligation

commitments, and debt of certain special purpose entities (i.e. Community

Development Authority) shall not exceed 4.5% of the estimated assessed value

of all real and personal property subject to taxation within the City.

In addition to the financial policies, repayment period of the debt should not exceed the

expected useful life of the capital project being funded. Included within this section, is the “Debt

Service Requirement” statement which shows the repayment of general bonded debt, literary

loans and revenue bonds for the City and the Virginia Air and Space Museum.

DEFINITIONS	OF

VARIOUS	TYPES	OF	DEBT





The City of Hampton’s debt service requirement includes the following debt instruments: Bond

Anticipation Notes (BANs), general bonded debt, school literary loans and debt associated with

land acquired using a Letter of Credit. Debt service requirements for the Enterprise, Internal

Service and Special Revenue funds are accounted for in that individual fund’s activity.

Bond Anticipation Notes

A municipal note issued to obtain temporary or short-term (one year or less) financing for

projects that will be repaid through the sale of bonds of a planned long-term bond issue.

Build America Bonds (BABS) Subsidy

The 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contained a provision for a new type

of municipal security designed to assist the City in raising funds for local infrastructure projects.

This program titled “Build America Bonds” program was under President Barack Obama’s

stimulus legislation as a means of lowering borrowing costs for state and local bond issuers such

as the City and directing money towards the construction projects that would in return generate

jobs.

Capital Lease

A Capital Lease is similar to a loan agreement for the purchase of a capital asset on installments

with fixed terms (number of months/years) and non-cancelable. The financing company’s (lessor)

services are limited to financing the asset; the City (lessee) pays all other costs including

insurance, maintenance, and taxes. Essentially, capital leases are considered a sale by the lessor,

and a purchase by the City (lessee), even though the title remains with the lessor. Leased assets

are capitalized and shown on the City’s balance sheet as a fixed asset with a corresponding non-

current liability (lease payable).

Debt Service

Debt Service refers to the amount of money necessary to pay principal and interest on

outstanding bonds or other debt. This amount, is also known as the debt service requirement ,

refers to the total principal and interest paid in a fiscal year and is referred to as the annual debt

service. “Total debt service” refers to the total principal and interest paid throughout the life of a

bond issue.

VARIOUS	TYPES	OF	DEBT





General Bonded Debt

General Bonded Debt is long term obligation debt that is backed by the “full faith and credit”

pledge of the City’s general fund revenues.

Line-of-Credit

The City has borrowed money using a line of credit in order to quickly take advantage of an

opportunity to purchase physical assets such as real property acquisitions. To date the City has

no outstanding notes.

The City has adopted financial policies relating to the amount of outstanding debt; the amount

of overlapping debt; annual debt service costs and the payout ratio on general obligations

indebtedness. The Commonwealth of Virginia imposes a legal limit of 10% of assessed valuation

on the amount of general obligation borrowings which may be issued by the City. For more

details regarding the City’s policies on debt, refer to the Compliance with City Financial Policies

section of this document.

Literary Loans

In accordance with the Code of Virginia 22.1-146, Virginia State:

Board of Education may make loans or, subject to the approval of the General Assembly, loan

interest rate subsidy payments from the Literary Fund to the school boards of the several school

divisions making application therefore in the manner prescribed by law, authorized by the

governing body and the school board, for the purposes of (i) erecting, altering or enlarging school

buildings in such school divisions; (ii) purchasing and installing educational technology

equipment and infrastructure; (iii) equipping school buses for alternative fuel conversions and

for construction of school bus fueling facilities for supplying compressed natural gas or other

alternative fuels; and (iv) refinancing or redemption of negotiable notes, bonds, and other

evidences of indebtedness or obligations incurred by a locality on behalf of a school division

which has an application for a Literary Fund loan for an approved school project pending before

the Board of Education. For the purpose of this section, "alternative fuels" means motor fuels

other than gasoline and diesel fuel.

The City’s indebtedness includes loans from the State Literary Loan Fund. One loan was used to

fund the City’s share of the New Horizons Technical Center, a regional high school vocational

and technical center. The other loans were used for major repairs or renovations to four

elementary schools and Hampton High School. Repayment is annual installments over a 20-year

term at 3% interest from General Fund resources.

VARIOUS	TYPES	OF	DEBT





Recovery Zone Economic Development Bonds Subsidy

A new type of bond created by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) passed by

U.S. Congress in February 2009. The bond proceeds maybe used to finance City projects with

economic development outcomes. These projects would have to take place in a “Recovery Zone”. A

recovery zone is defined as an area of the City that has significant poverty, unemployment, home

foreclosures or general distress or that has already been federally designated as an

Empowerment Zone or Renewal Community.

Revenue Bonds

The Hampton History Museum issued revenue bonds which are a special type of municipal bond

where repayment is solely from revenues generated from and associated with the Hampton

History Museum. Only those revenues specified in the legal contract between the bond holder

and bond issuer are required to be used for repayment of the principal and interest of the bonds;

other revenues such as property tax revenues are not so encumbered.

Budget Note: General Fund revenues and General Fund Balance will be used to finance Capital Projects in

FY13. The transfer to the IDA Fund - Bass Pro accounts for direct revenues generated by the store which

are set aside in an IDA account as part of the agreement between the City and Bass Pro, should they be

needed. Funding for the Hamptons Golf Course decreases due to completion of final lease payment. The

increase to the Convention Center can be attributed to higher revenue estimates for both the meals and

lodging taxes that are apportioned to the Hampton Roads Convention Center Fund.

Budget Note: The local contribution to the Schools, which totals $64,925,178 for FY13, is based on an agreed upon formula in which they receive a predetermined percentage of the growth in residential general property and utility taxes.

The net increase in the Commonwealth of Virginia's contribution to the School is approximately $7,265,877. The net decrease in the local contribution of $1,419,915 results from a decline in estimated revenues from real property taxes which is one of the drivers in the funding formula.

Relevant Excerpts from Chapter 781, 2009 Acts of Assembly, Regarding Budgeted Required Local Effort and Budgeted Required Local Match Item 140 A: 5. "Required Local Expenditure for the Standards of Quality" - The locality's share based on the composite index of local ability-to-pay of the cost required by all the Standards of Quality minus its estimated revenues from the state sales and use tax dedicated to public education and those sales tax revenues transferred to the general fund from the Public Education Standards of Quality/Local Real Estate Property Tax Relief Fund and appropriated in this Item, both of which are returned on the basis of the triennial census of school age population, as specified in this Item, collected by the Department of Education and distributed to school divisions in the fiscal year in which the school year begins.

6. "Required Local Match" - The locality's required share of program cost based on the composite index of local ability-to pay for all Lottery, School Facilities and Incentive programs, where required, in which the school division has elected to participate in a fiscal year.

“The City of Hampton fully

engaged its citizens and

stakeholders in developing the

Capital Improvement Plan.

Coliseum Central appreciates

the time and talent invested by

all in developing a plan that

will enhance our lives and the

lives of future generations.”

- Elizabeth McCoury





Capital	Budget



What is a Capital Improvement Plan?



A Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) is a five-year expenditure plan to finance the acquisition of

property and equipment and to fund new construction and other major improvements to existing public

facilities. The first year of the five-year plan is incorporated in what will become the Council Approved Budget as the Capital Budget component for the respective year.



Project Criterion and Expenditure Categories



Each locality establishes its own criteria for capital projects. The City of Hampton’s criterion for a

capital project is that it must have a cost in excess of $50,000 and a life expectancy of at least five years.

Although the nature and scope of capital improvement projects vary, each project usually falls into one of the

following ten expenditure categories:



1. The Education project category includes funding to support site improvements at Thomas Nelson Community College (TNCC) and assist Hampton City School’s with maintenance and renovation

projects.



2. The Hampton’s Waterways project category includes improvements to and maintenance of the

various waterways in Hampton.



3. The Maintenance of Public Properties and Performance Support project category include

maintenance and/or major improvements, including construction, to existing public facilities and

properties.



4. The Master Plans project category includes projects that implement the Community Plan through

various strategic investments.

5. The Neighborhood Support project category includes projects that improve the quality of

neighborhoods through the acquisition and demolition of blighted properties; housing improvement

grants and drainage repairs.



6. The New Facilities project category encompasses construction projects for all new public facilities.



7. Other CIP Projects category includes projects that do not fit within the other expenditure categories,

i.e. “Contingency,” which covers cost overruns due to increases in labor and/or materials and change

orders for previously approved General Fund capital projects.



8. The Other Economic Development Support project category includes projects that provide indirect

aid and support to improve/increase the City’s economic base.



9. The Public Safety project category include items specific to the service provision of the City’s public

safety departments.

10. The Streets and Infrastructure project category includes resurfacing and maintenance of streets,

roads and sidewalks. A tentative street resurfacing plan is developed annually by the City’s

Department of Public Works and published on their website at www.hampton.gov/publicworks under

the “What’s New” section.



Objectives of the CIP



The objectives of the CIP serve to:



 Execute projects that support the City of Hampton’s Community Plan and sustain Hampton’s vision

of making our community the “most livable community in Virginia.” The Hampton Community Plan

can be accessed on the World Wide Web at www.hampton.gov/community-plan/ under the

“Community Plan” section.



 Prepare the Capital Budget component of what will become the Council Approved Budget. The CIP

serves as one of many planning tools used during the budget development process.



 Maintain the City’s current bond rating by ensuring that conservative fiscal parameters are exercised

when scheduling and implementing projects to protect the City’s bond rating.



 Balance the City’s need for new and/or enhanced economic development with existing development

and capital renewal needs.



 Address and implement critical initiatives outlined in the Council Approved Strategic Area Master

Plans which can be accessed on the World Wide Web at www.hampton.gov/community-plan/ under

the “Strategic Master Plans” section.



 Merge the Hampton City Schools’ capital improvement plans with the City’s process.



CIP Development Process and Discussions



The annual development process commences with reviewing and analyzing of project funding

requests. Suggested projects come from a variety of sources such as City departments, City Council, citizen

groups and local business communities {referred to as business improvement districts [BIDs] in the City of

Hampton}. It is recommended that project submissions from citizen groups and BIDS be submitted through

and advocated by a City department to ensure the required due diligence is performed such as feasibility and

cost analysis. At the conclusion of the funding request review process, the CIP Committee meetings

commence.

Capital	Budget



CIP Development Process and Discussions (Cont’d)



Over several months, the CIP Committee takes the steps listed below in general terms to develop a

proposed plan. The CIP Committee is comprised of Assistant City Managers, Director of the Office of Budget

and Management Analysis, Director of Economic Development, Director of Finance, Director of Community

Development, Director of Public Works, Debt Manager, a Hampton City Schools’ representative and the CIP

Coordinator.



 Ensure the relevancy of the current year’s projects in light of any recent developments and

adjust where necessary.



 Review and categorize all new requests into one of the ten project categories. The projects

are then ranked based on an established set of criteria, i.e. legal requirements; investments

in maintaining current assets; strategic investments; implementation of Community Plan and

expansion of current service delivery).



 Review the Contingency List to determine if any projects can now be considered for funding.

The Contingency List consists of previously submitted projects not approved for funding.



 Review and confirm various revenue sources available to fund proposed projects.



Community educational forums and ‘citizen chats’ are also held during the CIP development process

and prior to any public hearings. These events provide citizens and business leaders with the opportunity to

learn about the process and communicate their priorities, values and concerns for various project areas. The

feedback received from such forums and ‘citizen chats’ are weighed during the decision making process.



Once the CIP Committee has reached a consensus on a proposed Plan, yearly expenditure and

revenue schedules are developed for each project. Determination is also made as to whether the proposed

plan is in compliance with the City’s Financial Policies as it relates to debt capacity as well as affordability.

The proposed Plan is then presented to the public and the governing bodies (Planning Commission and the

City Council) at their respective public hearings. After all public hearing requirements have been satisfied, a balanced CIP is then approved by the City Council, either as presented or with modifications, as the Council

Approved CIP. As previously mentioned, the first year of the approved five year plan is incorporated as the

Capital Budget component of what will become the Council Approved Budget for the respective year. The

Capital Budget can be revised during the Manager’s Recommended Budget development process and

subsequently by City Council prior to the approval of the City’s budget which must occur, by City Code, on or

before May 15th.



In light of the continued economic challenges such as declining real estate values and relative flat

revenue growth, the majority of projects included in the Capital Budget are maintenance in nature to preserve

and protect the City’s current assets. This course of action also minimizes the fiscal impact of project

implementation on the operating budget, including debt service payments.

However, there are two significant recurring expenditures included in the Capital Budget which are listed

below with further explanation:



 Hampton Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) ……. $1,183,000:

 Chesapeake Bay Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) …...…………… $1,000,000:



Inclusion of these two capital projects is the result of environmental mandates imposed by the

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality

(DEQ). It is estimated that these projects will be completed in 25 years.



The Hampton Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) is a system which

monitors and collects data on all sanitary sewer pump stations in the City of Hampton. The age

and limitations of Hampton’s existing SCADA system have contributed to the recommendation to

replace the aging system. Accurate data collection is the initial phase in what will be a series of

projects to update and/or replace portions of the sanitary sewer system. These expenses are

driven by the EPA and DEQ Consent Order requirements mandating a reduction, and eventual

elimination, of sanitary sewer overflows. Several years ago, when the Consent Order was first

negotiated, the Hampton City Council agreed to implement a surcharge on the Sewer User Fee

to both pay for and isolate these expenses. With increasing obligations, City Council approved

to increase the Sewer User Fee from $0.44 per 100 cubic feet of water consumption to

$0.66 per 100 cubic feet of water consumption. The base rate of $1.48 per 100 cubic feet for

general sewer maintenance remains unchanged. For the typical resident, this rate increase will

have a total annual impact of $14.52.

.

The Chesapeake Bay Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) will involve a series of projects

(Best Management Practices [BMPs]), based on the result of various watershed studies, that will

be designed to limit nutrient and pollution runoffs into the Chesapeake Bay. The watershed

studies will be utilized to determine the location and type of BMP to be installed or retrofitted, i.e.

bioretention, wet ponds, etc. These activities will be funded by an increase in the Stormwater

User Fee (commercial and residential). The Stormwater User Fee is the legal vehicle the

Commonwealth of Virginia gives localities to generate revenue in order to comply with the

mandates for dealing with the water quality management guidelines, emanating from the Federal

government through the EPA. DEQ then monitors localities performance in meeting the

requirements. The previous rate of $4.60 per month will be increased to $6.41 per month,

for a total increase of $1.81 per month or $21.72 per year. The commercial property rate also

increases by the same flat amount per ERU (equivalent residential unit), which in Hampton is

2,429 square feet of impervious area. This increase also funds the recommendations made by

Hampton’s Citizen Waterway Management Report to address items such as water quantity due

to sea level rise. Other recurring type of expenses that relate to educating the community on the

steps they can take to minimize the amount of nutrients entering the water are included.

City of Hampton





Capital	Budget

Criterion and Project Categories (Cont’d)



Please reference the “Supplemental Information” for a schedule of Taxes and Fees.”





The Capital Budget does include one significant, nonrecurring capital expenditure for which the City

of Hampton is also mandated to implement.



 Animal Shelter ………………………………….……………………………. $3,000,000:



Virginia State Code §3.2-6546 requires the provision and maintenance of a pound or shelter

where animals that are trapped or collected from the City or surrendered by its owner can be

taken. The City of Hampton, along with other Hampton Roads localities, is currently under a

contract with the Peninsula SPCA (SPCA) to provide shelter services. Hampton provides its own

field services. The SPCA has notified participating localities that as of July 1, 2013, they will no

longer provide the legal statutory pound services. The City of Hampton seized the opportunity,

in cooperation with other Hampton Roads localities, to construct a regional animal shelter facility.



Funding Sources



It is the City’s goal to use pay-as-you-go funding for annual, recurring maintenance-type projects.

Listed below are the four broad revenue categories which are used to fund capital projects in fiscal year

2013. Over the next five year period, a large portion of financing will come from the issuance of General

Obligation Bonds and dedicated Sewer User Fees and Stormwater Fees.



 Federal and State Government Revenues is typically one-time and dedicated for specific types of

projects such as street and road improvements. On occasion, a cash match may be required from

the City. Revenues under this category include:



o Urban Maintenance Contribution (UMC-VDOT) {represents the City’s match} $5,138,774

o Urban Development Action Grant Funds …………………………………..

$ 152,628



 General Obligation Bonds is revenue received from the issuance of municipal bonds which is used

to fund major one-time only capital expenditures and limit the amount of public funds designated for

new projects/new construction. The level of debt that Hampton can incur is governed by the Council

approved financial policies. Revenues under this category include:



o General Obligation Bond Proceeds (City) ………………………………….. $5,000,000

o General Obligation Bond Proceeds (Schools) ……………………………… $5,287,500



 Dedicated Taxes and Fees are revenues received from certain taxes and fees, as well as land

sales, to fund specific projects. Revenues under this category include:



o Economic Development Fund ……………………………………………..… $ 250,000

o Stormwater Fund ………………………………………………………………. $2,495,000

o Wastewater Fund ………………………………………………………………. $1,183,000

The projects being funded by the Stormwater Fund and the Wastewater Fund are listed in the

Capital Budget for disclosure purposes only. The actual revenues and expenditures for these

projects are collected and will be dispenses in their respective Funds.



Please reference the “Public Works Funds” for supplemental information.



 Contributions from the General Fund, which is the City’s major fund used to account for all

financial resources not accounted for in any other fund, generally supports maintenance-type

projects and one-time only capital expenditures. Revenue sources under this category include:



o General Fund Balance Transfer ……………………………………………… $2,500,000

o General fund Operating Revenue ……………………………………………. $3,232,265



Financial Policy Statement



The financial parameters for pay-as-you-go funding for capital improvement projects are that no less

than two percent (2%), but no more than six percent (6%) of estimated revenue for the annual operations of

the City, less Schools, shall be devoted to capital expenditures. The total estimated General Fund operating

revenues for fiscal year 2013 is $304,082,882. To adhere to this policy, contributions from the General Fund

(GF) which include General Fund Balance Transfer, General Fund Operating Revenues and the City’s match

for Urban Maintenance Contributions cannot be less than $6,081,658 and no more than $18,244,973. For

fiscal year 2013, the total amount of funds being transferred from the General Fund to the Capital Projects

Fund is $10,871,039 or 3.6% which is within the City’s financial parameters.



A second tier to the City’s financial policy, which was adopted on April 11, 2007 by City Council,

states that a minimum of 10% to 15% of the total capital improvement expenditures, over a rolling five-year

period, shall be funded from General Fund revenues. The five-year CIP totals $154,229,168 and the 10% to

15% minimum to be funded from General Fund revenues equal $30,408,288 and $45,612,432 respectively.

The City anticipates funding $55,546,040 or 36% from General Fund revenues over a five-year period. This

amount is in compliance with the policy parameters.



For information on the financial policies regarding the maximum amount of debt that the City can

issue, please reference the “Financial Summaries and Policies” section of the Fiscal Year 2013 Council Approved Budget document.





Some capital projects have a direct impact on the City’s operating budget once the project is

acquired or completed. This impact may require on-going expenses for personnel, operating costs and

capital outlay. Refer to the schedule entitled “Capital Budget Impact on Operating Budget” in this section regarding those projects and the anticipated impact on the operating budget. Projects funded through debt

financing also impact the operating budget through on-going debt service expenses.

CAPITAL	BUDGET	IMPACT

ON	OPERATING	BUDGET

Development of the fiscal year 2013 capital budget continued on a conservative path. The majority of projects

included in the Capital Budget are maintenance in nature and result from the City's continued focus on

maintaining current assets while minimizing the fiscal impact of project implementation on the City's operating budget, including debt service payments.

Implementation of capital projects which do have an impact on the City's operating budget are listed below.

Projects noted with an asterisk (*) are those with recurring significant expenditures as a result of environmental mandates imposed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Virginia Department of

Environmental Quality (DEQ).

Budget Note: The decrease in this budget is attributed to a higher than normal projection in fuel

Budget Note: The net increase in personal services is due to the elimination of four vacant positions,

gallon consumption in FY12 due to the expectation of an additional 50 school buses coming on line.

Additionally, the projection for parts was overstated due to unknowns related to Fleet Maintenance

and repair consolidation efforts.

“The staff are very friendly and

helpful and the greens are as

good as you will find in the

winter or summer. I also like that

they have three 9-hole courses

so there is always a course you

can play if you don’t have a tee

time.”

started about 42 years ago

when I was part of a group

who helped save it from being

developed into residential real

estate. It is where I play the

majority of my golf and where

I have built many friendships

that have lasted a lifetime.”

properties in Hampton and delivers the sewage to the Hampton Roads Sanitation District for treatment.

Revenue from this fund comes from the sewer user fees and from new tap fees that are collected for

connections to the system.

The total budget for the department is $11,087,988, which funds the following services in these approximate

amounts:

The review of revenue options was an intricate part of the City's Fiscal Year 2013 budget balancing strategies. The Budget Review Committee was tasked with reviewing fees and taxes charged to users and to suggest areas for tax and fee increases or the establishment of new fees. Comparability to other cities was a factor used to determine which fees or taxes could be increased along with polling the community regarding their tolerance for real estate tax changes.
