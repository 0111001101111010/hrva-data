THE DISTINGUISHED BUDGET PRESENTATION AWARD



The Government Finance Officers Association of the United States and Canada

(GFOA) presented a Distinguished Budget Presentation Award to the City of

Hampton, Virginia for its annual budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2010.

In order to receive this award, a governmental unit must publish a budget

document that meets program criteria as a policy document, as an operations guide,

as a financial plan, and as a communications device.



This award is valid for a period of one year only. We believe our current budget

continues to conform to program requirements, and we are submitting it to GFOA

to determine its eligibility for another award.

READER'S GUIDE TO THE CITY BUDGET

The City budget is an annual plan for the coordination of revenues and expenditures. The purpose of the budget is to provide information about the city’s operations and financial plans to citizens, elected officials and other interested parties. The budget provides a summary of information concerning all city departments, programs and services.

Each year, the budget development process includes a review of programs and services, the Hampton Community

Plan, the annual operating goals and priorities established by City Council, departmental work plans, the

performance contracts of city department heads, and financial data. The process involves collaboration and input from city agencies and staff, City Council, and citizens through various meetings, presentations, and public forums.

The Hampton City Council approves the annual budget. The budget presented in this document covers the period of July 1, 2011 through June 30, 2012.

Office of Budget and Management Analysis City of Hampton





City of Hampton

FY12 Manager’s

Recommended Budget





April 15, 2011



Mayor Ward, City Council Members and Citizens,



Enclosed you will find the FY 2012 Manager’s Recommended Budget totaling

$428,539,903, a 3.89% increase over the adopted FY 2011 budget. Of this grand total, the

City Operations budget is $243,648,430 (6.86% increase) and the School System portion is

$184,891,473 (0.22% increase).



However, I must caution that these numbers are deceiving in that they do not, at

first glance, convey the severity of the situation the City faced in this budget cycle. The total

City budgeted revenues increased by nearly $15 million. Yet, virtually all of this increase

was not available for general fund/governmental purposes. The following revenues (in

rounded amounts) had corresponding expense requirements that offset one another:



 Ft. Monroe payment in lieu of taxes for anticipated services

2,400,000

 Special tax assessments collected on behalf of & then

transferred to CDAs





5,800,000

 Increased incremental taxes for the Peninsula Town Center

CDA based actual performance of facility





340,000

 State Social Services revenue for mandated programs



1,025,616

TOTAL NEW RESTRICTED REVENUES:





9,565,616



Our budget also assumes the use of designated fund balance from departmental

savings to accomplish two significant initiatives – one to assist homeowners suffering from

repetitive flooding issues and the other to provide our hard-working employees with some

merit-based compensation enhancement. Both of these initiatives will be elaborated upon

later in this message. However, it is important to note that the $4.1 million proposed for use

comes from a one-time source of monies saved over many years by departments. These

uses – also one-time in nature – are an appropriate use of monies that we have been

carefully reserving for times such as these.



 Waterway investments/home elevation revolving loan program 2,500,000

 Employee one-time performance payment





1,600,000

TOTAL NEW ONE-TIME DESIGNATED FUNDING USE:

4,100,000



Together these two categories of revenues/expenses totaled nearly $13.7 of the $15.0

million City budget increase. While these revenues show up in the total revenue, they were

Recommended Budget





not available for general uses. Stated another way, if these revenues and expenses were

removed, the City budget would be essentially flat. While real estate taxes continued to

decline due to a weakened housing market regionally and nationwide, other revenues such

as personal property, sales and meals helped to offset these losses.



The expenditure side of the equation was equally challenging. Although revenues

were down, certain expenditures continued to grow faster than inflation. City health

insurance and gas increases are but two examples of expenses which needed to be

absorbed by the budget. Capital improvement plans called for a major infusion of

additional dollars in FY 2012 for both maintenance and enhancement projects. Debt service

increases were also required. New state mandates in the areas of youth and family services

as well as increased local match requirements for social services impacted the budget as

well.



Perhaps the largest single increase required was funding for the staff needed for the

new Northampton Fire Station planned to open during FY 2012. Nearly $1 million annually

will be necessary to operate that facility on a 24 hour a day/7 day-per-week basis. When

planning for this station began many years ago, no one could have predicted the worst

recession the country has faced since the Great Depression. Yet, staffing now becomes a

reality.



These unfunded expenditure pressures (as opposed to funded ones such as new

staffing required for Fort Monroe as noted above) coupled with flat revenue demanded

further expenditure cuts and some continued appropriate use of undesignated fund

balance in excess of policy for one-time capital projects. While some use of fund balance is

still included in the recommended budget for such projects, the amount is slightly reduced

from past years. This reflects an ongoing commitment to gradually replace the use of one-

time monies with recurring funds to the maximum extent possible without decimating the

base city operations.



All of this is in the way of noting that this budget was exceptionally difficult to

manage. While this budget was indeed somewhat less challenging than last year’s, we were

still facing tough choices and further reductions in city operations. And yet, as I read the

regional, state and national news, I must also note that our community has weathered the

recession better than many. Many cities and towns nationally are closing community

centers, public libraries, etc. Other communities have cut first-responders like police

officers and firefighters. While cuts to city services had to be made in this budget, we were

able to avoid truly draconian reductions.

City of Hampton

FY12 Manager’s

Recommended Budget





Hampton is blessed to have several economic projects that are coming to fruition at

this critical time – projects long-planned that will reap major dividends for the community

and the budget. Indeed, increased revenues from the Peninsula Town Center are included

in this proposed budget. The meals, sales and admissions taxes paid at the Center are an

instrumental factor in minimizing further reductions to city services. The Hampton

University Proton Beam Institute is also now open and we are confident that as more

patients come to the center, we will see improved lodging, sales and meals tax receipts

from it as well. So while our challenges were – and remain – great, we should recognize

and understand that the painful cuts we are enduring could have been much worse.



I am pleased that I am able to deliver a budget that I believe makes required cuts in

the least damaging manner. This is not to say that the cuts are pain-free. On the contrary,

all of the 16 permanent full-time positions that are recommended for elimination were

warranted and would have been funded were the City’s economic position different. All of

the operating budget cuts will be felt by departments as they struggle to serve our citizens

and there will be occasions when citizens may see a slight impact on service delivery.

Certainly, there will be constituents who will bemoan the reduction of an important service

to them. However, I believe we have protected the core services of the City to include

police, fire, emergency management, infrastructure management, garbage collection, etc.



I cannot overemphasize the importance of citizen input in this budget process. Over

the last several months, we have continued the extensive budget outreach we began last

year. We even increased the numbers of residents who participated – no small feat, given

last year’s mass efforts. We undertook this outreach because we understand that a budget

should, as much as possible, reflect citizen values. While all of our services are important,

we understood that cuts needed to be made; that any cut we would offer would be

disappointing to some; and, as a result, we needed to have as clear an understanding as

possible about the services residents most valued.



While there is not a perfect correlation between the input received from citizens and

our final recommendations, the citizens’ voices and thumbprints are embedded

throughout. Those services that rated the highest – such as fire, emergency services, police

and public works – were largely untouched in this budget. Some even grew slightly, such

as Police and Fire which added positions for the Fort Monroe transition and the new

Northampton Fire Station.



However, even services that were highly rated, received a thorough review by my

management team and me. We looked at each offering by each department to determine

the impact made for the city dollars invested. We asked questions such as: “Is this possibly

an outdated mode of service delivery?” or “Do we need to make changes to improve the

bottom line performance of this effort?” This critical examination led us to recommend

some limited changes in either departmental services and/or the way we executed that

business.



For instance, last year the Library was not affected by budgetary cuts. The decision

not to cut it reflected strong citizen comments about the criticality of the public library. Yet,

as we looked at the bookmobile function, we concluded it no longer served its original

purpose at the same levels of community impact. When first created, the bookmobile was

perhaps the only way young children got introduced to reading and the public library

system. Today, many programs exist to take the bookmobile’s place. First, public school

libraries have grown in number and collection size. The public library now has many

branch locations, making access easier than ever. Day care centers routinely make field

trips to the branch locations, reducing the need for the bookmobile to go to them. At-risk

four year olds get books they can take home to their personal library each month in their

school environment through the Mayor’s Book Club, a community-based partnership.

Further, the regional non-profit First Books also works to get books in the hands of

youngsters through a variety of means. Neighborhood learning centers are also more

prevalent in our community. These learning centers provide the technology access students

also need, and seek. While the bookmobile provides fond memories for many of us, it

certainly becomes a less necessary governmental service when looked at in this context.

Thus, this budget proposes the elimination of city government-provided bookmobile

service. Assuming Council supports this recommendation; we will look for a suitable non-

profit provider who may wish to continue the tradition in exchange for the donation of the

vehicle and its materials.



Spay and neuter coupons are another example of the outdated approach in a

nonetheless highly rated service area, animal control. For well over twenty years, the city

has funded spay & neuter coupons to help reduce the cost of these procedures. The goal of

the program – to help reduce pet overpopulation – is critically important. However, since

the spay & neuter coupon’s inception, a superior service delivery model – which the city

also funds – has emerged. Each month PETA provides low cost procedures in our neediest

neighborhoods. This program costs less and impacts more people thereby minimizing the

need for the original program. Accordingly, this budget zeros out the spay & neuter

coupon program while retaining our monthly PETA partnership.

In other cases – principally in the highly rated Public Works and Parks & Recreation

departments – we have also recommended some limited privatization/contracting out of

services to both save money and, possibly, enhance service delivery. National experience

teaches localities that it is important not to fully divest the community of capacity in any

given service; otherwise, the private sector can have the community at a distinct

disadvantage. However, we do believe there are opportunities to explore more active

engagement of our private sector in some of these larger service areas. Service contracts

will likely cost as much as the salaried public sector workers we would otherwise hire.

However, by going this route, we avoid the long-term benefits costs typically associated

with the public sector employee. This year’s budget proposes a piloting of efforts in Public

Works streets operations and Parks landscaping. In these cases, we will not fill currently

(or soon to be) vacant positions while engaging in contract operations over the first half of

the fiscal year. After that period, we will be able to evaluate whether the quality

enhancements and cost savings are as projected; and, if so, plan for more extensive

privatization/contracting in future years.



These are but a handful of examples where the critical examination of even the most

highly rated city services led to savings. I use these as illustrations of my management

team’s commitment to assuring that we use the taxpayer’s dollars wisely and only ask –

whether now or in the future – for additional dollars when we are fully convinced that the

remaining needs are real.



In other cases, lower community ratings did lead to reductions and/or new

approaches, as suggested by community polling and confirmed by our collective

management evaluation. For instance, the Teen Center has not yet achieved attendance

levels that support its annual budget. In examining contributing factors, we have

concluded that dual management of the facility – by city staff and contract staff – is not

ideal and leads to unnecessary, duplicative overhead. Accordingly, this budget proposes a

restructuring of our approach. This budget eliminates the city staff and instead will rely

entirely on a contracted service approach. By eliminating the extra layer of management,

we will save over $117,000 annually and yet assure the continued operation of the facility.

During the next year, we will work with the successful contractor to modify operations to

achieve higher levels of participation. Should we be unsuccessful in achieving this goal, we

will proceed with planning other possible expanded uses of the facility including, but not

limited to, offerings for seniors.



Some services – such as the History Museum and the Arts Commission – were rated

low last year and again this. Interestingly, however, few residents actually supported

5

City of Hampton

FY12 Manager’s

Recommended Budget





outright elimination. After last year’s budget reductions, I felt deeper cuts would have

rendered these programs so “beyond bare bones” as to be practically inoperable and thus

akin to elimination. Instead, I am proposing some management changes that I believe will

stabilize and even possibly improve performance. In the case of the History Museum, we

will end the historian contract so that we can fund a full-time professional museum

manager. Equipped with the right skill sets, a professional manager should be able to come

in and greatly increase admissions, members, sponsorships and grants.



In the case of the Arts Commission, I have tasked the Coliseum Director and Arts

Commission Director with finding a way to implement the successes of an integrated

entertainment management organization here in Hampton, much as Norfolk does with its

Scope, Chrysler Hall and other cultural venues. Through such a collaboration, some central

business function and administrative overhead may be shared, thereby reducing some

costs. Also, through the more widespread marketing arm of the Coliseum, we should be

able to increase attendance at the American Theater over time. The combined effect of such

changes would lead to stronger financial performance, thereby reducing the general fund

support of the arts in time.



Youth prevention and early intervention services – which were less highly rated this

year than last – were also largely held constant. We have opted to preserve them because of

clear evaluative data that establishes that cuts in these efforts will result in larger long-term

reactive services. We endeavored to not fail prey to the trap of being “penny wise and

pound foolish” with regard to these important services and only made changes.



These are but a few examples of how citizen input shaped the development of this

budget. Other management influenced cuts – such as the elimination of vacant positions,

the retirement/separation incentive program savings, a handful of other contracting out

decisions (such as for some information technology services as well as graphics and

research support in lieu of filling permanent full-time positions) – all led to this balanced

budget recommendation.



I am pleased to report that there is only one revenue recommendation in this

budget. Like the Newport News City Manager, I am recommending an increase in the

cigarette tax from the current 65 cents per pack to 75 cents per pack. This increase will

generate about $265,000 for us and is critically important in providing necessary funding

for the Northampton Fire Station staffing. After completing all the reductions and

management changes noted above, I simply could not recommend further, deeper cuts to

city departments to completely fund the staffing of what is, effectively, a new service. As



Office of Budget and Management Analysis

6

City of Hampton





City of Hampton

FY12 Manager’s

Recommended Budget





cigarette usage leads directly and indirectly to both fire and emergency medical calls for

service, this minor rate change to support these services is appropriate.



Thus far, I have focused on the major reductions or management shifts contained in

this budget. However, there are a few enhancements of which I am particularly proud. Not

only does this budget fully fund the necessary firefighters for the Northampton Fire Station

but it also adds significant funding for waterway and flooding concerns. The signature

piece of this additional funding is a Home Elevation Revolving Loan Program which will

make affordable, low-interest loans available to homeowners wishing to elevate their

residences. Priority will be given to those homes which have suffered repetitive flood loss.

While details of the program (such as term, actual interest-rate, application process, etc.)

still need to be finalized, the $2.5 million provided in this budget would serve

approximately 50 homeowners (based on an average $50,000 per home elevation estimate).

This program is to be structured as a revolving loan, meaning that as installments on the

first loans are paid additional loans to other homeowners will continue. This program

responds to a higher resident emphasis on the need for governmental efforts to address

waterway management concerns of residents, doing so through a shared partnership

between the public sector and the private homeowner. Other waterway investment

opportunities can also be considered with this money. Certainly, there will be many

worthy projects for consideration once our community group completes its work later this

calendar year. In the meantime, this hazard mitigation need – discussed and endorsed by

the Tidal Flooding Subcommittee – makes logical sense as a departure point.



To ensure the continued success of our waterway initiatives, this budget also

proposes to fund – for the first time – a certified hydraulics engineer. Having such a staff

specialist on board should help better guide city investments and assist in the

design/evaluation of future waterway projects. The City needs this level of expertise on

staff given the nature of our coastal community.



Other new investments are of a lesser dollar value but have the potential to make

lasting impacts on the community. For instance, we have added extra funds ($11,000) to

extend our partnership for homeless housing via HELP. The successful Night’s Welcome

Program was expanded in FY 2011 to offer shelter on days and evenings during extreme

weather events. In FY 2012, the next phase of our efforts to expand services will see an

additional four weeks of service added to the program. HELP has agreed to work with us

to add a month of service each fiscal year until we are serving this vulnerable population

all year long. A five-year commitment of $30,000 per year, for a total of $150,000, is

suggested to support the Sentara Nightingale campaign. We will also make technological

Recommended Budget





enhancements to our city computing system to enhance our boards and commission

application and review process.



Altogether, these budgetary strategies have enabled us to give the community a

balanced budget that, I hope you will agree, simultaneously makes appropriate cuts and

investments in our community.



The most challenging aspect of this budget is the impact on our work force. All of

the people who happen to be in jobs we will cut are good, hard-working folks. The most

painful part of these downsizing decisions is knowing that wonderful people who put their

heart and soul into serving the community each and every day get hurt. Let me assure you

that I will personally work with Human Resources to do right by all of these employees.

Fortunately, the numbers we will impact this year are significantly less than last year. The

position eliminations this year total 16; but, because most are vacant, only 6 people will be

personally impacted. As we did last year, we will do all we can to place folks into jobs for

which they are qualified and interested. I am encouraged that, through our hiring freeze

and retirement incentive, we already have many open positions in which employees may

potentially be placed.



However, even the positions that do not have people in them will affect the

departments from which they come. As I have already documented for you on several

occasions, our workforce is very lean. Cutting any position makes a major impact on those

left behind. These cuts will demand shared sacrifice organizationally. That sacrifice

includes even my office which has contributed to the position eliminations.



Those who remain, however, deserve recognition. Whether it is the “big” things

(like clearing our arterial roads of 12 inches of snow after Christmas better than any other

city in the region) or the “little” things (like the day-in and day-out service delivery they

execute most times so flawlessly), they continually excel. It is truly remarkable what we

achieve in light of the tight fiscal situation in which we manage.



This budget did not afford me the opportunity to return to our annual recurring

merit salary increases. However, I could not, in good conscience, fail to provide some

measure of compensation enhancement for this workforce. Therefore, as noted earlier in

this message, I am proposing a one-time performance payment to each employee who has

earned a 3 or higher (out of 5 possible) on their annual merit review. This one-time

performance payment will be equal to $500, after taxes, for all permanent full-time



Office of Budget and Management Analysis

City of Hampton





City of Hampton

FY12 Manager’s

Recommended Budget





employees and $250, after taxes, for all part-time/WAE employees. The payment will be

made in the first paycheck of the fiscal year in a lump sum. In so structuring this

compensation to employees, we are getting more money in the pockets of our lower-

salaried employees than a 1% general wage increase might otherwise have provided.

Employees making less than $50,000 a year, net more funds from such a plan. Moreover, by

providing the funds all at one time, at the start of the year, instead of over 26 pay periods,

the effective buying power of the money will be stronger, sooner. This performance

payment is being funded out of prior departmental savings that have accrued over the

years. It is fitting to return a portion of the funds to the very employees who helped create

those savings. While I wish I could have done more, this payment should assure our

workforce that their efforts are noticed and appreciated.



I would be remiss if I did not note that, even as we go about the process of adopting

the FY 2012 budget, staff is already looking ahead to FY 2013 and beyond. We endeavored

to make our balancing decisions fiscally responsible not only for this year but also for the

future. I believe we honored this need in virtually every recommendation we made.

However, we have relied on a limited use of one-time revenues – such as the use of fleet

management reserves to offset the increase in fuel prices which we hope will level off as

the unrest in the Middle East subdues – that, while prudent now, MAY cause challenges

next year if our assumptions prove false. Looking ahead, I plan to propose changes to the

post-retirement health care benefits for new hires in the coming months after a complete

examination of potential impacts to our grandfathered health insurance plan status. I am

also actively engaged in conversations with our School Superintendant and fellow

Newport News City Manager about potential joint purchasing and/or service delivery

opportunities. By actively working on potential joint efforts early in the year, we should be

poised to make more specific recommendations in the next budget cycle.



In closing, as previously stated, this budget required cuts, new ways of doing

business and one minor tax increase to fund new service. I truly believe we have made the

tough choices we were called upon to make in the least damaging manner possible and in a

way that is respectful of the resident input. I want to publicly acknowledge and thank a

wonderful group of department heads, assistant city managers and budget team for

ensuring that this challenging budget accomplished these goals. I must also highlight a

larger group of employees who last year helped me shepherd in a whole new level of civic

engagement around the budget process. This year that same team enhanced our “I Value”

campaign. Our time in the community has been incredibly uplifting and insightful. To

demonstrate the impact of the citizen comments on this budget in an even more overt way,

you will find that this budget document continues to feature the names, voices and

Budget Policies and Practices

Budget Basis of Accounting

I. Budget Basis of Accounting

a. Modified accrual basis of accounting is used in preparing the budget for governmental

type funds including General Fund, Special Revenue Funds, Capital Projects Fund and

School Fund.

i. Under the modified accrual basis revenues are recognized when they become

both measurable and available to finance the operation of the current year and

expenditures are recorded when the liability is incurred.

1. Revenues prone to accrual consist primarily of property taxes, certain

grants, sales taxes and utility taxes

a. Real and personal property taxes are recorded as revenue when

levied and billed, net of allowances for uncollectible amounts.

i. Property taxes not collected within 45 days after year-end

are reflected as deferred revenue.

2. Revenues from federal, state and other grants are recorded at the time

of receipt of notification of grant.

3. Sales and utility taxes are collected by the State or the utility company,

generally in the month preceding receipt by the City.

ii. Expenditures, other than interest and principal on long-term debt, are

recorded when the liability is incurred.

iii. Interest and principal on long-term debt are recognized when due.

b. Accrual basis of accounting is followed in the Internal Service Funds and Enterprise

Funds.

i. Revenues are recognized when earned and expenses are recognized when the

related liability is incurred.



II.

Financial Accounting

a. Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) shows the status of the City’s

finances on the basis of “generally accepted accounting principles” (GAAP).

i. General Fund and School Operating Funds are legally adopted on a basis

consistent with GAAP.



III.

Budgetary Levels/Controls

a. Annual appropriation ordinance sets the authorized expenditure levels for each

department.

i. Personal Services

ii. Operating Expenses

iii. Capital Outlay

b. Department heads are given total responsibility and accountability for staying within

their Council approved appropriation level.



Office of Budget and Management Analysis

27

City of Hampton





FY12 Council



Approved Budget



Budget Policies and Practices

i. Departmental budgets are constantly monitored by the department heads, the

budget office and the finance department to ensure that no appropriation is

overspent and that all estimated revenues are realized.

1. Budget to actual expenditure and revenue reports are prepared

quarterly to gauge how the overall budget is tracking.





IV.

Budget Amendments/Transfer Process

a. Adjustments to the adopted budget ordinance may become necessary in order to carry

out planned programs, new Council initiatives and unexpected expenditures.

b. Three types of adjustments:

i. Budget amendment is used to request a transfer of appropriations between

departments within a fund and to increase the budget for a particular fund.

ii. Budget transfer is used to request the transfer of appropriations between line-

items and budgeted categories.

iii. Budget amendments or any revisions that alter the total appropriation

(revenues or expenditures) of a department or fund must be approved by

Council on a quarterly basis.





V.

Budget Savings/Reserves

a. Encumbrances or funds intended to be used for a specific purpose or program that is

not completed by the end of the fiscal year are put into an assigned fund balance

account.

i. Funds are then put into the appropriate department’s new fiscal years’ budget

to finalize the commitment.

b. Unencumbered or unexpended/non-committed appropriations lapse at the end of the

fiscal year.

i. Normally, departments that have unencumbered funds at fiscal year end will

retain 65 percent of these funds. However, due to city-wide budgetary

constraints, these funds have not been returned to the departments for fiscal

years 2008-2010.

ii. Ten percent is put into an innovations pool to fund technological needs for

collaborative projects between departments.

iii. The remaining funds are split between the City’s drainage program

(approximately $500,000) and committed fund balance account commonly

called budget savings.

Budget Policies and Practices

VI.

Fund Balance Classification

The Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB), an independent organization

that establishes and improves standards of accounting and financial reporting for U.S.

state and local governments, issued a standard on fund balance classifications that the

City is required to apply to the fiscal year 2011 (CAFR). The standard is GASB Statement

Number 54, "Fund Balance Reporting and Governmental Fund Type Definitions”. The

purpose of this statement is to improve comparability, increase transparency and improve

the usefulness of governmental fund balance information.



The implementation of GASB Number 54 will not impact the FY12 Council Approved

Budget. The purpose of this policy is to set forth the different classifications of fund

balance and the level of authority required to assign or commit these funds. On July 13,

2011, GASB 54 will be presented to City Council for adoption.



An accounting distinction is made between the portions of fund balance that is spendable

and non-spendable.

a. The Hampton City Council has the authority to set aside funds for a specific purpose.

Any funds set aside as Committed Fund Balance requires the passage of a resolution.

The passage of the resolution must take place prior to the end of the applicable fiscal

year. If the actual amount of the commitment is not available by the end of the fiscal

year, the resolution must state the process or formula to calculate the actual amount

as soon as information is available. Commitments may be changed or lifted only by

the City Council taking the same formal action that imposed the constraint originally.

b. Assigned Fund Balance consists of amounts that are intended to be used by the City

for a specific purpose that is neither restricted nor committed. The intent should be

expressed by the governing body itself or an official such as the City Manger that the

governing body has delegated the authority to assign amounts to be used for specific

purposes. Assigned Fund Balance differs from Committed Fund Balance in that

assignments do not require a resolution.

c. Unassigned Fund Balance (formerly undesignated fund balance) is the amount of

fund balance in the General Fund which cannot be classified as nonspendable,

restricted, committed or assigned. It represents funds available for immediate

appropriation. The City’s Financial Policy states the City will maintain an

Unassigned Fund Balance equal to 10% of total General Fund and School Operating

Fund revenues.

d. Nonspendable Fund Balance includes items where the cash will not be realized in the

next year. Examples would be inventory, long-term receivable, or a fund that is

legally or contractually required to be maintained intact such as a permanent fund.

e. Restricted Fund Balance is where the constraints placed on these funds are either

externally imposed by creditors, grantors, laws or regulations of other governments or

they are imposed by law through constitutional provisions or enabling legislation.

Office of Budget and Management Analysis City of Hampton





FY12 Council

Approved Budget



DESCRIPTION OF BUDGETED FUNDS



The descriptions below explain the purpose of each of the funds listed in the “Summary of

Budgeted Funds” pages.

GOVERNMENTAL-TYPE FUNDS



The City’s adopted budget contains appropriations for four major and nine non-major

governmental-type funds. The General Fund, Capital Improvement Fund, Debt Service Fund,

and the Economic Development Fund are all considered major governmental funds. Of the nine

non-major governmental funds, only four are appropriated and presented in this budget:

Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), Stormwater Management and the two

Community Development Authorities, namely the Peninsula Town Center and the H20 which

are presented in the Contributions to Outside Agencies tab. The modified accrual basis is used

to budget all governmental-type funds.



General Fund

The General Fund accounts for all revenues and expenditures that are not required to be

accounted for in a special purpose fund. This Funds’ revenue source are taxes and fees

generated at the local level, such as real estate, personal property, utility taxes, etc. The

General Fund finances most of the regular day-to-day operations of the City. The following

descriptions refer to the individual General Fund appropriations transfers to other funds within

the City.



 Transfer to Capital Improvement Fund is a fund that accounts for financial

resources to be used for the acquisition or major construction of capital assets

such as land, buildings, parks, streets and roads. In order for expenditures to be

eligible for the capital budget, they must cost over $50,000 and have a life

expectancy of five or more years.



 Debt Service Fund is a fund that accounts for the accumulation of resources for and

the payment of general long-term debt principal and interest of the City. Primary

resources of the Debt Service Fund are derived from transfers from the General

Fund and the proceeds from the refinancing of existing bonds.



Office of Budget and Management Analysis

FY12 Council

Approved Budget



DESCRIPTION OF BUDGETED FUNDS



 School Operations Fund is a special revenue fund which is the depository for

specifically identified revenues received from the Commonwealth of Virginia for

schools which are then transferred to the School Operating Fund; in addition to

the expensing of the City’s local match to the schools.



 Retirement and Employee Benefits are where the City’s budgeted fiduciary

obligations/activities are reported within the Retirement and Benefits section of

this budget document. The City excludes these activities from the City’s

government-wide statements because the City cannot use these assets to finance

its operations. The City is the trustee, or fiduciary for its employees’ pension

plans: Hampton Employees Retirement System (HERS) and the Virginia

Supplemental Retirement System (VRS).



 Transfers to Other Funds facilitate inter-fund transfers in order to support the

functions to be carried out by the receiving fund. General Fund transfers to other

funds may be made for operating as well as capital purposes.



Special Revenue Funds

Revenues in this fund are restricted for a specific purpose. Examples of special revenue funds

are Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Fund and the Economic Development Fund.



 Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Fund is the depository for the funds that

are awarded to the City annually from the Department of Housing and Urban

Development. CDBG funds are used to complement other resources in the

implementation of the Healthy Neighborhoods Initiative.



 Economic Development Fund was established as a depository to fund public

improvement projects or purchases and acquisition of land in support of economic

development efforts, the revenue source of which is to be derived primarily from land

sales and rents.

DESCRIPTION OF BUDGETED FUNDS

PROPRIETARY-TYPE FUNDS



The departments within these Funds are accounted for on a similar basis as a private business.

The City maintains two types of propriety funds; Internal Service and Enterprise Funds. These

funds are budgeted using the full accrual basis for budgeting.



Internal Service Funds

These funds are used to account for the financing of goods or services provided by one

department or agency to other departments or agencies of the City, on a cost reimbursement

basis. The Internal Service Fund departments include Fleet Management, Information

Technology, and Risk Management.



 Fleet Management Fund accounts for the operations of the City’s central automotive

maintenance and major vehicle service facility.

 Information Technology Fund accounts for the costs of providing the following services:

computer technical support, internet and telecommunications services.

 Risk Management Fund accounts for the costs of providing insurance coverage and

certain self-insured liabilities of the City and the School Board.



Enterprise Funds

Enterprise Funds operate in a manner similar to private businesses in which operating

expenses are completely or partially recovered from income collected from user fees charged to

the general public. The Hampton Roads Convention Center, The Hamptons Golf Course, and

the Wastewater Management Fund are considered major Enterprise Funds. The non-major

funds are the Coliseum, Woodland Road Golf Course, Solid Waste Fund, and the Steam Plant.

For presentation purposes, the Solid Waste, Steam Plant, and the Wastewater funds are

presented under the “Public Works Funds” section of this document.



 Hampton Coliseum Fund accounts for revenues generated and expenses associated

with shows, meetings, civic/community events and other activities provided by the

Coliseum.

FY12 Council



Approved Budget



FINANCIAL POLICIES

General Fund

The City Council adopted a set of financial parameters to guide future City expenditure patterns.

These financial policies and their compliance with the approved budget are outlined in this section.



City Tax Revenue Guideline

City Council approved a guideline for budget development in which real estate tax revenue growth

(net of new construction) from one fiscal year to the next shall be limited to the equivalent

percentage increase of an inflationary growth factor as measured by either the consumer price

index for urban dwellers (CPI-U) or resident income growth (RI); whichever is greater in any given

year. To the extent that budgetary needs require real estate revenues to grow faster than this

factor, the Manager and Council shall explicitly explain the budget driving factors causing this so

that residents may have a concise and clear understanding of the need to deviate from this

financial guideline.



For FY 2011, the real estate assessment growth is expected to average 0.15%. This growth is below

the guidelines established by City Council and therefore, the guideline stated above was not

applied to the Fiscal Year 2011 Budget.



City Financial Policy

In April 2007, the City Council amended its existing financial policies. The financial policies relate

to general operating elements of the City. These policies are used as financial planning parameters

during the annual budget process. The five (5) financial polices and the actual results are

summarized below. The City’s FY12 Council Approved Budget is in compliance with all five

policies.



1. Debt Limit Policy #1. This policy is comprised of three guidelines as outlined below:

(a) General obligation debt shall not exceed 3% of the assessed value of all real estate within

the City subject to taxation. The legal debt limit authorized by the Virginia State Statute

limits bond issuing authority up to 10% of the assessed value. The FY12 estimated

general obligation debt will total $298.9 million or 2.7% of taxable real estate value

($10,937,433,365), which is within the policy parameter.

(b) General obligation bonded debt together with indirect debt, which includes certain

revenue backed debt and subject-to-appropriation or moral obligation commitments, and

debt of certain special purpose entities (i.e. Community Development Authority) shall not

exceed 4.5% or $533.7 million of the estimated FY12 assessed value of all real and

personal property subject to taxation within the City. The current level of net

direct/indirect/overlapping debt is $509.9 million or 4.3% of the assessed value of all

taxable real and personal property which is within the policy parameter.

(c) Debt of certain special purpose entities, such as community development authorities, shall

not exceed 1% of the assessed value of all real and personal property subject to taxation

FINANCIAL POLICIES

within the City. The expected amount is $102.1 million or 0.9% of the approximate FY12

assessed value of all taxable real and personal property, which is within the policy

parameter.

2. Debt Service Limit Policy #2. General obligation bonded debt and indirect debt shall not

exceed 10% or $43.9 million of the City’s total General Fund, School Operating Fund and

Convention Center expenditures of which all are included in the City’s total debt service. The

total annual debt service cost equals $40.4 million or 9.2% of total expenditures, which is

within the policy parameter.

3. Debt Retirement Policy #3. The City shall retire 60% of the principal balance of general

bonded obligation debt within 10 years of the date the debt is issued. The City will retire

approximately $201.8 million or 67.5% of general bonded obligation debt by FY 2022, which is

within 10 years.

4. Equity Funding Policy #4. This policy is comprised of two guidelines as outlined below:

(a) A minimum of 2% to 6% of general fund revenues will be applied to Capital Improvement

Plan (CIP) projects each year. For FY12, the percentage of revenues utilized for capital

expenditures are estimated to be $11.5 million which is 3.7% of General Fund revenues.

(b) A minimum of 10% to 15% of CIP projects over a rolling five-year period are to be funded

from general fund revenues. For the five year period, FY12 through FY16, the City plans

to use an estimated $59.4 million or 49.6% of General Fund revenues on CIP projects.

5. Unassigned Fund Balance Policy #5. The City will maintain an unassigned General Fund

balance equal to 10% of total General Fund and School Operating Fund revenues less School

transfers. The unassigned fund balance at June 30, 2011 is forecasted to be $53.6 million of

which $4.2 million will be utilized for one-time operating expenditures and the capital

budget in fiscal year 2012. This will leave a remaining unassigned fund balance of $49.4

million. For FY12, the estimated revenues are projected to total $419.6 million; ten percent

or $42.0 million is the minimum required unassigned fund balance. The City’s projected

FY12 balance will be $49.4 million which is in excess of this policy by $7.5 million at 11.8%.

To the extent unassigned fund balance falls below the policy, the shortfall shall be

replenished over a three-year period.

The City is in compliance with the Financial Policy Guidelines.



CREDIT RATINGS

The City’s credit ratings are as follows: AA+ by Standard and Poor’s, Aa2 by Moody’s Investor

Services and AA by Fitch Rating. A credit rating is a financial indicator to the public/investor as to

the credit worthiness (quality) of a debt issue such as bonds. See Debt Management Policies, page

311 for further details.

for Recordation tax due to a decline in home sales.

in court fines.





Revenues from Use of Money & Property

reflects a $301,114 decrease from FY11 based upon the decline of interest rates. Overall this category

shows a total $352,854 decline from FY11.





Charges for Services





This category consists of revenues from fees charged by court officers, the Sheriff’s department,

recreation, ambulance services, Healthy Start Programs, Healthy Family Partnership Classes, Library

fines/fees, legal services, landfill host fees and miscellaneous fees. For FY12, the Arts Commission was

Funding, for these programs, is affected by the Governor’s 2011-2012 Biennial Budget. The estimated

Services Programs which increases their FY12 revenue by $1,025,616.

$706,000. For Street & Highway Maintenance revenues, the Virginia Department of Transportation has

EXPLANATION OF EXPENDITURES

Increases/(Decreases) for Fiscal Year 2012

Increase/

Category

Y (Decrease)

Explanation

Constitutional, Judicial

($8,389)

The net reduction in this category is attributed to

Electoral

salary savings from the separation and retirement

programs implemented in FY11 and the elimination of

a position in the Treasurer's Office. These reductions

were offset by increases in the General District Court

for increased public defender costs along with increases

in the Voter Registrar and Electoral Board budgets as a

result of the upcoming redistricting, primaries, etc.

Economic Vitality &

(126,138)



The reduction in this category is reflective of the

Neighborhoods

elimination of a vacated managerial position in

Economic

Development,

the

elimination

of

a

managerial position in Convention and Visitor Bureau

due to retirement and contracting out the service.

Infrastructure

(117,916)

The net reductions in this category results from the



transfer of the Herbicidal function to the Stormwater

Fund and the elimination of a position due to

retirement. Reductions are offset by the addition of a

Hydraulics Engineer. In addition several functions in

this business team will be contracted out on a trial

basis.

Leisure Services

1,532,350



The majority of this increase is attributed to the

transfer of the Arts Commission/American Theater

function to the General Fund from the EXCEL Fund.

There is no longer a dedicated source of revenue for

services previously funded in EXCEL. This increase is

offset by a decrease in Transfer to Other Funds. The

remaining increase is attributed to funding of several

community-based agencies such as the Newtown

Learning Center, Y. H. Thomas Community Center,

Kids' Cafe' at the Y. H. Thomas Community Center and

the New Life Learning Center.

Public Safety

251,451

Th e net increase funds an additional fifteen (15) Fire

Department positions to staff the new Northampton

Fire Station.

Costs are offset by savings from

reductions in Police and Strategic Customer Service due

to attrition and filling positions vacated from

retirements and separations at a lower pay rate.

Explanation

Quality Government

1,568,132

The increase in this business team funds municipal



services that will be provided to Fort Monroe once the

Army vacates in September. The cost of providing those

services are offset by revenues. In addition, due to

restructuring, several positions were eliminated and

services will be contracted out.

Funding is also

provided for a Disparity Study.

Youth and Families

650,903

The majority of this increase is attributed to an

increase in Social Services programming approved by

the State. An increase in revenues from the State is

reflected in the General Fund Revenue section of this

budget.

Retirement and Employee

2,217,810

The increase in this budget funds a 5.1% increase in

Benefits

health

insurance

premiums

and

an

one-time

performance payment contingent upon a performance

rating of three (3) or higher based on the eligible

employee's merit review.

Contributions to Outside

9,189,171



The net increase is attributed to the addition of the

Agencies

Peninsula Town Center and H20 CDAs which is offset

by revenues reflected in the General Fund Revenue

section of the budget. Also included is funding to create

a Home Elevation Revolving Loan Program as well as

increased funding for the Hampton Roads Transit and

the Regional Jail. Funding was reinstituted for the

Sister Cities program and in support of the Regional

Air Service Enhancement Committee at Patrick Henry

Airport and in support of

safety and accessibility

efforts of the Peninsula Stadium Authority at War

Memorial Stadium.

Debt Service

1,472,984

Debt Service increases to pay principal and interest on

funds borrowed for various capital projects. This

increase is less than initially anticipated due to scaled

back borrowing for projects because of the economic

climate.

The increase in this category funds maintenance

The reduction in the local contribution to schools is the

result of an agreed upon formula in which the schools

PURPOSE OF DEPARTMENTAL BUSINESS TEAMS



Two of the City’s departmental business teams reflect minor changes in FY12. The Arts

Commission was transferred to the Leisure Services business team and the 911-311 Call Center

was renamed Strategic Customer Services and is located in the Public Safety business team.

The City’s seven business teams: Constitutional, Judicial and Electoral Offices; Economic

Vitality and Neighborhoods; Infrastructure; Leisure Services; Public Safety; Quality

Government and Youth and Families continue to provide services in areas the City Council

deemed critical.

The City Manager and staff continue their commitment to present the budget according to key

business team areas. As city departmental budgets are presented in the business area for which

they have the most direct link, it is important to note, however, that many departments

contribute to more than one business area.

Business teams focus the City’s organization on the initiatives selected by their elected and

appointed leaders.

The business teams are facilitated by the City Manager and the Assistant City Managers to

achieve an interconnectedness that is critical in today’s operating environment. Business team

management enhances financial control and long-range planning by requiring that all

departments focus not only on their individual needs but also on the needs of the business unit

as well. The teams are expected to develop annual and long-range goals; integrate departmental

plans to key business unit plans; share resources across departmental lines as necessary;

eliminate disparity in the application of organizational policies; and most of all, make a positive

and substantial contribution to the attainment of the City’s mission statement – to be the most

livable city in Virginia.

Increasing demands for services with dwindling local, state and federal revenues compel us to

tighten financial and operational control in the organization. The clustering of departments into

key business units accomplishes that goal. More importantly, however, business team

management will allow us to be better prepared for future challenges such as homeland

security; human self-sufficiency development; and redevelopment. No one department acting in

isolation can prepare our citizens or community for these challenges – it takes a strong,

coordinated and integrated effort on the part of multiple departments and outside entities to

achieve what our community will need in the future.

As the court of record, the mission of the Clerk of the Circuit Court is to professionally, respectfully and competently serve the citizens of the Commonwealth of Virginia, particularly those who reside in the City of Hampton, as they interact with the judicial system.

Under State policy, the State should be paying 100% of the cost of operating the Clerk of the Circuit Court's

office. However, over the years, the General Assembly and State Compensation Board have failed to

adequately fund the salaries or positions needed to more effectively run the Office.

The following accounting of revenues shows the amount actually paid by the State as well as the locality's

subsidy of the State's responsibility. If the State was fully funding its obligation, the amount of local aid to the State could be reallocated to other City priorities.

Under State policy, the State should be paying 50% of the cost of operating the Commissioner of the

Revenue's Office. However, over the years, the General Assembly and State Compensation Board have

failed to adequately fund the salaries or positions needed to more effectively run the Office.

The following accounting of revenues shows the amount actually paid by the State as well as the

locality's subsidy of the State's responsibility. If the State was fully funding its obligation, the amount of

local aid to the State could be reallocated to other City priorities.

Jury trials are exclusive to the circuit court.

The Hampton Police Division is committed to providing the highest quality service to our citizens.

Acting in partnership with the community, we will be proactive and promote a responsive and flexible

approach to quality of life issues.

The total budget for the department is $20,823,722, which funds the following services in these

The Chief of Police and his staff provides the overarching policing philosophy through the establishment of Division Rules and Regulations, goals and objectives, plans, policies and procedures. The Chief is guided by federal, state and local laws as well as standards established by the Commission for Accreditation of Law Enforcement Agencies in order to develop and maintain a professional and responsive law enforcement agency dedicated to provide efficient and effective police services to the citizens of Hampton.

Operations Management

10,252,198

$

196.0

The Police Operations function is perhaps the most visible aspect of the Division. Its main purpose is to prevent, suppress, and respond to crime. As a result, the city of Hampton has one of the lowest crime rates per capita in the region. In calendar year 2010 officers respond to over 153,000 calls for service, generated through the 911 center or through direct citizen contact, with an average response time of 7.58 minutes for high priority calls in FY10.

Investigations

3,535,210

$

64.0

Our goal is to reduce the occurrence of violent crimes within the City of Hampton by 2.5% and increase the clearance rate by 2% over the next two years. Reduce the occurrence of property crimes within the City of Hampton by 2.5% and increase the clearance rate by 4% over the next two years. Increase the number of narcotic and weapon law violation investigations within the City of Hampton by 3.5% and increase the clearance rate by 4% over the next two years. The personnel assigned to Investigations identify and interview witnesses and suspects, collect evidence, arrest offenders, and assist with criminal prosecutions. Taking violent and career offenders out of the community allows the City of Hampton to maintain one of the lowest crime rates in the region. Investigations currently maintains a case clearance rate equal to or better than surrounding jurisdictions for both persons and property related crimes.

Essential Support Services

1,684,319

$

37.0

The Records function is responsible for the collection, storage security and disposition of criminal records, accident reports, summonses, warrants, property and evidence. All activity is subject to stringent state mandated regulations and/or national accreditation standards, and is subject to periodic state and federal audits. The Crime Analysis Unit is responsible for the collection, analysis, and routine reporting of crime information to assist Uniform Patrol and Investigative Services in identifying criminal patterns and activities. The Criminal Intelligence Unit is responsible for the collection, collation, analysis and dissemination of intelligence information which assists the organization in identifying likely offenders and determining why crime is happening in certain areas.

Professional Standards

882,103

$

The Professional Standards function operates to assure officers are hired, trained, and perform in a way consistent with organization needs, codes of conduct, laws, policy and procedures, the criteria set forth by the National Accreditation standards and public expectations. The function recruits for approximately 40 vacancies a year, trains those hired, and maintains records/credentials/training of 100% of the officers in the department. It provides the critical internal affairs function of investigating complaints against police officers.

Homeland Security

462,471

This Division works with state and federal agencies in securing Hampton and the city’s port from terrorist threats and/or attacks. A unit consisting of well-qualified and professional officers is able to work closely with the Chief of Police and City officials as well as those of adjoining jurisdictions to implement problem-solving strategies. These preventative strategies foster security for the citizens of Hampton and increase the attractiveness of the City to tourists.

Community Relations

Budget Note: This reduction is a combination of an equivalent six positions due to attrition which is predicated on personnel savings trends from prior years. This same philosophy holds true for FY12 especially based on the economic conditions and slow recovery projected for the next two to three years. Also, savings in personnel is due to the retirement of senior and junior officers, thus, filling these vacated positions at the entry level provides savings for the upcoming year.

The position count also reflects the addition of five new police officers for Fort Monroe services. The funding for these positions is included in non-departmental under Fort Monroe Municipal Services.

STRATEGIC CUSTOMER SERVICE (911~311)

This department is comprised of two call centers - the Emergency Communications Center (911), and the

Customer Call Center (311). The Emergency Communications Center is the critical component in emergency

services, receiving and dispatching police, fire, emergency medical services and animal control. The 311

Customer Call Center provides easy, convenient access to non-emergency city information and city services

using a single, easy-to-remember phone number (3-1-1) with a customer service level that is unparalleled in

the business.

The total budget for this department is $3,007,832, which funds the following services in these approximate amounts: FY 12

FY 12

Budget

Positions

911 Emergency Communications Center

$ 2,058,511

50.0

Provide customers with accurate, timely information regarding emergency disasters and unusual or severe weather events. By using the one easy to remember number, customers already are conditioned to contact the call center during emergency events.

Call center staff directly support the Emergency Operations Center by monitoring trends and rumors of an event and therefore provide customers with the most accurate information available. The call center tests our business continuity plan bi-annually and participates in all EOC table top exercises. The call center will provide support to the EOC during activations and/or exercises and provide accurate, timely information to our customers even if a disruption of phone service occurs.

Public Safety Information Center

$ 222,038

7.0

To provide police support services to the citizens of Hampton, 24 hours per day 365 days per year. These services include receipt of citizen crime reports via telephone and documentation of offenses in the incident based reporting system. Provide support to officers in the field by accessing national and state crime information systems, entering stolen vehicles and missing persons and other non-emergency activities from patrol such as phone calls and contacting other law enforcement agencies.

311 Call Center ~ Customer Assistance

$ 447,157

10.0

Provide easy, convenient access to city information and services using a single, easy-to-remember phone number (3-1-1), 24

hours a day, 7 days a week, providing service beyond customer’s expectation. Citizens find that “just one call does it all,” with knowledgeable staff whose goal is to delight the customer. The Call Center uses a customer focused approach and with a cross-trained staff, the Call Center provides citizens with a “just one call – does it all” access to local government services and information. Satisfaction is based on number of calls handled on a daily/monthly/yearly basis, call wait-time, call talk time, abandon rate, number of services processed vs. informational calls and citizen’s reporting very-good to excellent service from call center staff. Service goal is to reduce call wait-times to under 60 seconds and to increase our “very-good to excellent”

survey results from 93% to 94%. This will decrease the on-hold time reaching an advocate and increase customer satisfaction.

311 Resource Management

$ 58,630

1.0

Providing timely, accurate information is paramount to good customer service. Accurate and timely information is at the heart of delighting our customers. Our FAQs and script-flow for service requests are used internally by the advocates to process calls and our FAQs are also published on the Web for customer self-service. The 311 Resource Management reviews over 4,000 frequently asked questions – 50 - 75% of the FAQs are reviewed annually and is the system administrator that manages the 311 database and software systems. Research & provide new, timely information regarding services, events and updates for over 47 various departments (many with numerous divisions) and agencies, modifying script-flow as needed.

Measurement for this service is based on the accuracy of FAQ’s, number of FAQs modified or added, new services added, and emails processed.

The staffing count is offset by the mid-year addition of a Special Projects Manager who is dedicated to working on the Fort Monroe transition. All related expenses, i.e. salary, will be reimbursed by funding received from the Commonwealth through the Fort Monroe Authority. Otherwise, this is a maintenance level budget.

Contingency's mission is to provide a reserve account that funds unanticipated and/or emergency

expenditures which occur during the course of a fiscal year. Contingency is also utilized to cover any

shortfalls that occur during the year due to loss of revenues. Contingency funds are transferred to various

City departments or projects when the need arises.

The total budget for this function is $1,111,388.

Budget Note: By nature, it is difficult to predict in advance how these monies will be used since it is

included for unanticipated requirements. In prior years, uses have included supplemental funding for

jails, equipment purchases for courts and other City/State offices, legal fees and unexpected revenue

shortfalls. The decreased funding in Contingency is the result of reducing the amount of funds set

aside for a possible State revenue shortfall in Fiscal Year 2012. Even with this significant decrease,

Contingency is funded at less than one-half percent of the City's budget excluding School funding. It

is standard practice for contingencies to be funded at two to four percent of the budget. There are no

actual expenditures for FY08-FY10 because Contingency funds are transferred to other departments

where the actual expenditure has occurred.

NON-DEPARTMENTAL

Non-departmental is a multi-purpose appropriation which serves to fund those items that cannot

easily be assigned to any one department such as the Indirect Cost Allocation Plan, the payment of

the City's general liability insurance premiums, leases for City offices located in non-City buildings

and consultant fees associated with Council initiated projects.

The total budget for this department is $5,770,075.

Disparity Study. These additions are offset by the elimination of one (1) full-time position and the budget

directly related to the 2010 Hampton Celebration; reductions from the one-time funding for the Hall of Fame;

re-engineering budget, and the elimination of the spay/neuter coupon program.

HUMAN SERVICES ~ Comprehensive Service Act

The Comprehensive Services Act for At-Risk Youth and Families requires that locally coordinated

services be provided to families whose children are at high risk of out-of-home placement. The approach

allows agencies to focus their combined efforts on the total needs of families instead of being driven by

the agencies' different administrative structures and regulations. This budget covers the local required

match for service delivery to these families.

The total budget is $1,974,095, which funds the following service:

Note: Funds that were formerly allocated to individual departments now come to the City in one

block grant that is jointly administered by the departments of Health, Human Services, the

Community Services Board, Juvenile Court Services, the School Board, a private provider and a

parent representative. Examples of these purchased services are foster care, residential special

education placements and placements made by the Juvenile Court

RETIREMENT AND BENEFITS DESCRIPTIONS



Accrued Payroll

The City pays its employees on a bi-weekly basis during the fiscal year which begins July 1st

and ends June 30th. For General Fund departments, any pay days within the first pay period of

the fiscal year that relate to the month of June is (accrued) charged back to the closing fiscal

year. The total amount accrued is charged against this accrued payroll account instead of the

individual departments’ salary expense line-item. This satisfies the principles of the modified

accrual basis of accounting that the City uses.



Compensation: Pay and Minimum Wage Adjustments and Sustained

Performance Program

The City appropriates monies for mid-year promotions and position upgrades in order to retain

successful employees and stay in-line with comparable market ranges. This budget line-item is

also the funding source for federally imposed minimum wage adjustments and the City’s

Sustained Performance Program for Master Officer, Senior Police Officers, etc. For FY 2012, the

approval of a one-time performance pay contingent upon a rating of three (3) or higher based on

the eligible employee’s annual performance review.



Hampton Employees Retirement System (HERS) Contribution

HERS is a City provided retirement plan that was designed to supplement the retirement of

those City employees eligible for participation in the Virginia Supplemental Retirement System

(VRS). HERS covers all full-time salaried employees who were first hired prior to July 1, 1984.

The City is required to contribute an actuarially determined rate which currently is 15.85%

(FY09 rate) of annual covered payroll. For FY12, the budget for HERS increases by $352,000.



Hospitalization Insurance (Self Insured)

Currently, the City offers one medical plan, Anthem Blue Cross/Blue Shield KeyCare (PPO

plan) to all eligible active and qualified retired employees. For FY12, approximately 82% of

eligible City employees will participate in the plan. This plan is supported by the City and its

subscribers. For active employees, the City’s premium portion averages approximately 71% and

the employee’s share averages approximately 29% depending on the type of employee coverage.

The estimated increase in premiums is expected to be 5.1% which will be applied to both the

City and employee’s share. The City also offers vision and dental plans to its eligible employees

and retirees; however all premiums are paid in full by the enrollee through payroll deductions.

The City of Hampton does not budget funds for these plans.

RETIREMENT AND BENEFITS DESCRIPTIONS





Life Insurance

All eligible permanent full-time employees are automatically covered under the basic group life

insurance program provided by Minnesota Life for VRS members and retirees. The premium

costs are calculated as a percentage of the employee’s annual salary. Effective July 1, 2010, the

group life insurance rates decreased from 0.79% to 0.28% as approved by the Virginia Governor

and General Assembly. The City pays the entire life insurance premiums of 0.28% for all

eligible employees/retirees.



Other Fringe Benefits

This budget represents miscellaneous fringe benefits such as deferred compensation as a part of

the City Attorney, City Manager and Municipal Clerk’s compensation package.



Workmen’s Compensation (Self Insured)

The City is exposed to various risks of loss related to torts; theft of, damages to and destruction

of assets; error and omissions; injuries to employees and natural disasters. The City has an

established Risk Management Fund (Internal Service Fund) to account for and finance its

uninsured risk of loss and the cost of providing insurance coverage such as automobile, general

liability and workmen’s compensation. Since the City is self-insured, this appropriation is

essentially a General Fund transfer to the Risk Management Fund to support this self-insured

liability of the City. For FY12, the Risk Management Fund will absorb the increase cost of

$148,050.



Separation Leave Pay

Employees who retire or separate from employment with the City are entitled to receive

payment for unused sick and vacation leave. According to the City’s Personnel Policies Manual,

active employees who are eligible for separation benefits have an established maximum number

of hours that can be paid out. Upon separation, other than retirement pay, employees will

receive sick leave pay of $20 per day up to a maximum of 720 hours. For retirees, sick leave is

paid up to 720 hours based on an hourly rate equivalent to one-half of the employee’s annual

salary. For both separating and retiring employees, vacation leave pay will be based on the

employees hourly rate on the date of separation up to the maximum accrual payout set forth in

the Personnel Policies Manual.

Social Security (FICA)

This is the employer portion of the Medicare tax obligations for all paid employees.

Contributions are calculated utilizing a combined rate for Social Security and Medicare (7.65%)

applied to a predetermined wage base.



Unemployment Insurance

The City pays unemployment tax on the first $8,000 of wages earned for each employee during

a calendar year. The percentage rate applied is computed by the Virginia Department of

Taxation. The City is estimated to pay approximately $240,000 in unemployment taxes for

Fiscal Year 2012.



Virginia Retirement System (VRS) Contribution

The City of Hampton contributes to the VRS, an agent and cost-sharing multiple-employer

defined benefit pension plan administered by the Virginia Retirement System. All full-time,

salaried employees of the City must participate in the VRS Plan. Members are required by Title

51.1 of the Code of Virginia (1950), as amended, to contribute 5% of their annual reported

compensation to VRS. The City of Hampton has assumed the 5% member contribution in

addition to its 15.34% required payment based on an actuarial basis specified by the Code of

Virginia and approved by the VRS Board of Trustees.





Voluntary Retirement Incentive Program

This is the first of two initiatives utilized to provide a pool of vacant positions for future

restructuring/streamlining of city operations as part of the FY2012 budget development

process. This is a voluntary retirement incentive program which offered a financial incentive to

city employees (employed by the City of Hampton on or before February 1, 2011) who were

eligible for either reduced or unreduced retirement under the Virginia Retirement System

(based on age and years of service). The incentive offered a one-time payment equal to 20% of

the employee’s base annual salary. Eligibility was contingent upon the employee retiring no

later than July 1, 2011.

Voluntary Separation Incentive Program

This is the second of two initiatives utilized to provide a pool of vacant positions for future

restructuring/streamlining of City operations as part of the FY 2012 budget development

process. This is a voluntary separation incentive program which offered a financial incentive to

city employees who are:

 vested VRS members (having at least 5 years of VRS service)

 employed by the City of Hampton on or before February 1, 2011 – exclusive of Hampton’s

Grant Fund; and

 had two or more years of continuous employment with the City

The incentive offered a one-time payment equal to 20% of the employee’s base annual salary.

The eligibility was contingent upon the employee separating no later than June 17, 2011, and

stipulated that the employee could not be re-hired by the City for 3 years.



Line of Duty Pay



According to the Virginia Code 9.1-400, the Line of Duty Pay (LODA) applies to any first

responder or public safety employee who dies or becomes disabled in the line of duty. The plan,

which is a component of the Virginia Retirement System, will provide death benefits and

continued health insurance coverage to disabled persons, their spouses, dependents and

surviving spouse and dependents of deceased law-enforcement officers and firefighters. VRS

has created a fund for payment of program benefits. The City is mandated by the State to make

contributions to this plan on behalf of its public safety employees.

Office of Budget and Management Analysis City of Hampton

DEBT MANAGEMENT POLICIES



The City maintains a separate Debt Service Fund that tracks long-term debt obligated for General

Fund activities. Debt activity for Enterprise, Internal Service, Special Revenue and Public Works

Funds are maintained in those individual funds. The Debt Service Fund accounts for the

accumulation of resources (monies) for and the payment of general obligation debt of the City.

Primary resources of the Debt Service Fund are derived from transfers from the General Fund and

the proceeds of any refunding bond issues.



The City borrows money by issuing bonds or notes. According to the City Code, bonds and notes in

anticipation of bonds may be issued for the purposes authorized by Council. The City issues this debt

in order to fund (pay for) projects within its Capital Improvement Program.



There are several reasons why the City may choose to borrow money: to fund current and future

needs; share the cost of a project with those utilizing the facility (project) in the future and to avoid

excessive cost burden on current taxpayers.



The City sometimes uses short-term obligations (e.g. Bond Anticipation Notes, Capital Leases, and

Line of Credit) to bridge the time gap between initiation of a project/purchase and the anticipated

bond issuance, when the nature of a purchase precludes the issuance of long-term debt, or when it is

fiscally responsible to do so. Prior to the issuance of any short or long-term obligations, the City

considers the effect on their financial position, the ability to repay, and the Commonwealth of

Virginia imposed legal debt limit.



Each fiscal year, the City of Hampton supports the acquisition, construction, renovation and

infrastructure maintenance stated in its five-year adopted Capital Improvement Plan. The capital

projects are funded from pay-as-you-go current revenues (general operating revenues), federal and

state revenues, appropriation from fund balance and the issuance of general obligation bonds. The

CIP provides a foundation to plan and structure debt in advance. The repayment period of the debt

should not exceed the expected useful life of the capital project for which the debt is incurred. In

doing so, specific sources are identified and dedicated to the retirement of debt. On April 11, 2007,

the City adopted a financial policy regarding the minimum amount of general fund revenues that

can be used to fund the CIP each year and over a rolling 5-year period. Each fiscal year the capital

budget, which represents the first year of the five year CIP, is adopted as a part of the overall City’s

Council Approved Budget.



The planned bond issuance of $40.6 million in the FY11 Council Approved Capital Budget was

postponed until FY 2012. The revised issuance totals $42.9 million and was approved in the FY 2012

budget. The City plans to issue $35.2 million in July 2011 and the remaining $7.7 million in January

2012. This January 2012 bond issue includes $500,000 for City capital projects and $5.2 million for

School Major Renovation and Maintenance.

DEBT MANAGEMENT POLICIES

For the fiscal year 2012, the Hampton City School will continue to contribute $2,000,000 to pay for

part of the debt service attributed to the school major renovation and maintenance projects.



The City’s credit ratings are as follows: AA+ by Standard and Poor’s, Aa2 by Moody’s Investor

Services and AA by Fitch Rating. A credit rating is a financial indicator to the public/investor as to

the credit worthiness (quality) of a debt issue such as bonds. These agencies evaluate the City’s

credit risk based on the following areas: record of debt payments on time, consistent and strong

revenue growth; diverse, balanced revenue streams, reasonable, controlled expenditures, level of

liquid reserves (including fund balance) and strong financial planning. The highest credit ratings are

Aaa (Moody) and AAA (Standard & Poor’s). Both agencies have intermediate ratings and default

ratings of Ca, C (Moody) and D (Standard & Poor’s). The bonds with default ratings are more likely

unable to repayment of the debt.

DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS



This section contains information on the City’s debt service requirement for the next five years.

Debt service is similar to a mortgage; the City borrows funds by selling bonds and agrees to pay

the money back to the purchasers of those bonds over a 20 to 30 year period. These funds

received by the City are used for the acquisition, construction and renovation of public facilities

and infrastructure as well as major equipment purchases.

The rate of interest paid for borrowing these funds is determined by credit ratings from rating

agencies such as Standard and Poor’s, Moody’s Investor Service and Fitch Rating. The City’s

credit worthiness is rated similar to the credit ratings of an average citizen. The better the

score, the lower the interest rate charged on borrowing. The highest credit ratings are Aaa

(Moody) and AAA (Standard & Poor’s).

The City ensures that it does not borrow more than it can afford by adopting a set of financial

policies. For debt services the following policies apply:

 General obligation debt shall not exceed 3% of the assessed value of all real

estate within the City subject to taxation.

 General obligation bonded debt together with indirect debt, which includes

certain revenue backed debt and subject to appropriation or moral obligation

commitments, and debt of certain special purpose entities (i.e. Community

Development Authority) shall not exceed 4.5% of the estimated assessed value

of all real and personal property subject to taxation within the City.

In addition to the financial policies, repayment period of the debt should not exceed the

expected useful life of the capital project being funded. Included within this section, is the “Debt

Service Requirement” statement which shows the repayment of general bonded debt, literary

loans and revenue bonds for the City and the Virginia Air and Space Museum.

DEFINITIONS OF VARIOUS TYPES OF DEBT

The City of Hampton’s debt service requirement includes the following debt instruments: Bond

Anticipation Notes (BANs), general bonded debt, school literary loans and debt associated with

land acquired using a Letter of Credit. Debt service requirements for the Enterprise, Internal

Service and Special Revenue funds are accounted for in that individual fund’s activity.

Bond Anticipation Notes

A municipal note issued to obtain temporary or short-term (one year or less) financing for

projects that will be repaid through the sale of bonds of a planned long-term bond issue.

Build America Bonds (BABS) Subsidy

The 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contained a provision for a new type

of municipal security designed to assist the City in raising funds for local infrastructure projects.

This program titled “Build America Bonds” program was under President Barack Obama’s

stimulus legislation as a means of lowering borrowing costs for state and local bond issuers such

as the City and directing money towards the construction projects that would in return generate

jobs.

Capital Lease

A Capital Lease is similar to a loan agreement for the purchase of a capital asset on installments

with fixed terms (number of months/years) and non-cancelable. The financing company’s (lessor)

services are limited to financing the asset; the City (lessee) pays all other costs including

insurance, maintenance, and taxes. Essentially, capital leases are considered a sale by the lessor,

and a purchase by the City (lessee), even though the title remains with the lessor. Leased assets

are capitalized and shown on the City’s balance sheet as a fixed asset with a corresponding non-

current liability (lease payable).

Debt Service

Debt Service refers to the amount of money necessary to pay principal and interest on

outstanding bonds or other debt. This amount, is also known as the debt service requirement ,

refers to the total principal and interest paid in a fiscal year and is referred to as the annual debt

service. “Total debt service” refers to the total principal and interest paid throughout the life of a

bond issue.

DEFINITIONS OF VARIOUS TYPES OF DEBT

General Bonded Debt

General Bonded Debt is long term obligation debt that is backed by the “full faith and credit”

pledge of the City’s general fund revenues.

Line-of-Credit

The City has borrowed money using a line of credit in order to quickly take advantage of an

opportunity to purchase physical assets such as real property acquisitions. Currently, the City

has one outstanding note from November 26, 2001, payable in annual installments through

November 26, 2011.

The City has adopted financial policies relating to the amount of outstanding debt; the amount

of overlapping debt; annual debt service costs and the payout ratio on general obligations

indebtedness. The Commonwealth of Virginia imposes a legal limit of 10% of assessed valuation

on the amount of general obligation borrowings which may be issued by the City. For more

details regarding the City’s policies on debt, refer to the Compliance with City Financial Policies

section of this document.

Literary Loans

In accordance with the Code of Virginia 22.1-146, Virginia State:

Board of Education may make loans or, subject to the approval of the General Assembly, loan

interest rate subsidy payments from the Literary Fund to the school boards of the several school

divisions making application therefore in the manner prescribed by law, authorized by the

governing body and the school board, for the purposes of (i) erecting, altering or enlarging school

buildings in such school divisions; (ii) purchasing and installing educational technology

equipment and infrastructure; (iii) equipping school buses for alternative fuel conversions and

for construction of school bus fueling facilities for supplying compressed natural gas or other

alternative fuels; and (iv) refinancing or redemption of negotiable notes, bonds, and other

evidences of indebtedness or obligations incurred by a locality on behalf of a school division

which has an application for a Literary Fund loan for an approved school project pending before

the Board of Education. For the purpose of this section, "alternative fuels" means motor fuels

other than gasoline and diesel fuel.

The City’s indebtedness includes loans from the State Literary Loan Fund. One loan was used to

fund the City’s share of the New Horizons Technical Center, a regional high school vocational

and technical center. The other loans were used for major repairs or renovations to four

elementary schools and Hampton High School. Repayment is annual installments over a 20-year

term at 3% interest from General Fund resources.

Recovery Zone Economic Development Bonds Subsidy

A new type of bond created by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) passed by

U.S. Congress in February 2009. The bond proceeds maybe used to finance City projects with

economic development outcomes. These projects would have to take place in a “Recovery Zone”. A

recovery zone is defined as an area of the City that has significant poverty, unemployment, home

foreclosures or general distress or that has already been federally designated as an

Empowerment Zone or Renewal Community.

Revenue Bonds

The Hampton History Museum issued revenue bonds which are a special type of municipal bond

where repayment is solely from revenues generated from and associated with the Hampton

History Museum. Only those revenues specified in the legal contract between the bond holder

and bond issuer are required to be used for repayment of the principal and interest of the bonds;

other revenues such as property tax revenues are not so encumbered.

TRANSFER TO OTHER FUNDS

While the General Fund is the main funding component of City operations, there

are many other accounting funds included in this budget document. Several of

these funds require a subsidy from the General Fund in order to completely

operate or because of a legally negotiated agreement. The following funds

receive subsidy from the general fund and a schedule showing the amount of the



General Fund contribution is included in this section: Capital Projects Fund, Debt

Fiscal Years 2008 - 2012

The General Fund has historically transferred money to various other funds. For FY12, support will go toward Capital Projects, Bass Pro Fund, The Hamptons Golf Course Fund, and the Convention Center Fund. These transfers are used to subsidize and support the activities of those funds or reflect transfers based on development agreements.

in FY12. The transfer to the Bass Pro Fund accounts for direct revenues generated by the store are set

aside in an IDA account as part of the agreement between the City and Bass Pro, should they be

needed. The decrease in EXCEL Fund reflects the transfer of the Arts Commission and other

community contributions to the General Fund. Funding for The Hamptons Golf Course Fund remains

constant. The increase to the Convention Center can be attributed to higher revenue estimates for both

the meals and lodging taxes that are apportioned to the Convention Center Fund.

Budget Note: The local contribution to the Schools, which totals $66,345,093 for FY12, is based on an agreed upon formula in which they receive a predetermined percentage of the growth in residential general property and utility taxes. The net increase in the Commonwealth of Virginia's contribution to the School is approximately $1,112,680. The net decrease in the local contribution of $706,383 results from a decline in estimated revenues from real property taxes which is one of the drivers in the funding formula.

CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PLAN POLICIES





Purpose



The purpose of the Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) is to provide a structured process for funding major

acquisitions, improvements and new construction projects in the City of Hampton. Generally, projects

included in the CIP must have a useful life of at least five years and initial costs in excess of $50,000.





Financial Policy Statements



The financial parameters for pay-as-you-go funding for capital improvement projects are that no less than

two percent (2%), but no more than six percent (6%) of estimated revenue for the annual operations of the

City, less Schools, shall be devoted to capital expenditures. The total estimated General Fund operating

revenues for fiscal year 2012 is $310,243,523. To adhere to this policy, contributions from the General

Fund (GF) which include General Fund Balance Transfer, General Fund Operating Revenues and Urban

Maintenance Contributions cannot be less than $6,204,870 and no more than $18,614,611. For fiscal year

2012, the total amount of funds being transferred from the General Fund to the capital projects fund is

$11,556,767 or 3.7% which is within the City’s financial parameters.



A second tier to the City’s financial policy was adopted on April 11, 2007 by City Council and states a

minimum of 10% to 15% of the total capital improvement expenditures, over a rolling five-year period,

shall be funded from General Fund revenues. The five year CIP totals $119,608,178 and the 10% to 15%

minimum to be funded from General Fund revenues is equal to $11,960,818 and $17,941,227 respectively.

The City anticipates funding $59,378,183 or 49.6% from General Fund revenues. This amount is in

compliance with the policy parameters.



While current revenues provide funding for some capital projects, other revenues are received from Federal

and State sources such as the Congestion Mitigation Air Quality (CMAQ) Funds, Federal Emergency

Management Agency (FEMA)/Pre-Mitigation Flooding Funds, Highway Safety Improvement Program

(HSIP) Funds and Regional Surface Transportation Program (RSTP) Funds. However, over the next five

year period, a large portion of financing will mainly come from the issuance of General Obligation Bonds.

For financial policies regarding the maximum amount of debt that the City can issue, refer to the Financial

Summaries Policies section of this document.



It is the long-term goal of the CIP Committee to use pay-as-you-go funding for annual, recurring

maintenance-type projects, funding from General Fund Balance for construction and Economic

Development projects. Bond proceeds are used to fund major one-time only capital expenditures and limit

the amount of public funds designated for new projects/new construction.

CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PLAN POLICIES



CIP Process



Each year, as part of the annual budget process, the City Council updates its five-year forecast for capital

improvements. Based on the requests made by various City departments, community groups and revenue

projections, the CIP Committee makes a recommendation to the Planning Commission, City Manager and

City Council identifying those capital projects being changed, added or deleted and new projects that have

become a high priority.



Capital projects include such items as road extensions and intersections, new construction of public

facilities, maintenance of existing facilities and the acquisition of land for future public use. The CIP

projects are classified into one of ten categories:



 Education

 New Facilities

 Hampton’s Waterways

 Other CIP Projects

 Maintenance of Public Properties

 Other Economic Development Support

and Performance Support

 Public Safety

 Master Plans

business and it is the City’s expectation that the revenues collected offset the expenses

related to conducting business. The exception to the above listed departments is the

The Public Works Funds include those City departments that charge a fee to users of their

services; typically residents of the City. Many of these departments were once in the general

fund but were put into specialized funds because of a state or federal mandate pertaining to

increased costs involving an environmental issue. It was decided that it was best to have

these departments in a separate fund so as to obtain clearer accounting of the fees charged

for the services.

The Steam Plant is a facility which burns City and Federal government refuse to generate

steam that is sold to NASA to meet their energy needs. The residue ash from the burning

process is disposed of at the landfill. Revenues for the operation of the Steam Plant come

from the sale of steam, tipping fees for private trash haulers and the Solid Waste Enterprise

Fund. The Steam Plant operates in accordance with all Federal and State environmental

laws and standards.

B L O C K GRANT

I’m grateful for the ramp that the City of

Hampton provided through CDBG funding. The

“ramp is a life saver. Without it, I cannot get in and

out of my house. Going to my therapy and

doctor’s appointments would have

been impossible

without the ramp.

Not only is it help-

ful, but it is also of

high quality and

was completed

quickly.

I value

COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT and HOME FUND

Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and HOME Funds are awarded to the City of Hampton on an

annual basis from the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to develop viable urban

communities by providing decent housing, a suitable living environment and economic opportunities

principally for low-to-moderate income persons. The City uses these funds to complement other resources in

the implementation of the Hampton Neighborhood Initiative. The rationale for determining priorities for

housing and community development needs is based upon census data and the needs identified during the

implementation of the Hampton Neighborhood Initiative. The Housing and Community Development

Issues and Strategies are fully described in the City's 2011-2015 Consolidated Plan for Housing and

Community Development.

Notes: The City of Suffolk has four tax zones, with real estate tax rates ranging from $.94 to

$1.34. Per Suffolk staff, the majority of its citizens are levied at the $.94 rate. In FY 1994-95,

Suffolk changed its method of appraising personal property from using 50% of retail value to

using loan value, which is generally lower than retail value. The loan value method is used by

other Hampton Roads Communities.

The City of Chesapeake has a base real estate tax rate of $1.04 and a base personal property

tax rate of $4.00. However, the rates are increased by $.01 and $.08, respectively, for mosquito

control.
