The Distinguished Budget Presentation Award



The Government Finance Officers Association of the United States and Canada (GFOA)

presented a Distinguished Budget Presentation Award to the City of Hampton, Virginia for its

annual budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2009. In order to receive this award, a

governmental unit must publish a budget document that meets program criteria as a policy

document, as an operations guide, as a financial plan, and as a communications device.



This award is valid for a period of one year only. We believe our current budget continues to

conform to program requirements, and we are submitting it to GFOA to determine its eligibility

for another award.

READER'S GUIDE TO THE CITY BUDGET

The City budget is an annual plan for the coordination of revenues and expenditures. The purpose of the budget is to provide information about the city’s operations and financial plans to citizens, elected officials and other interested parties. The budget provides a summary of information concerning all city departments, programs and services.

Each year, the budget development process includes a review of programs and services, the Hampton

Community Plan, the annual operating goals and priorities established by City Council, departmental work plans, the performance contracts of city department heads, and financial data. The process involves collaboration and input from city agencies and staff, City Council, and citizens through various meetings, presentations, and public forums. The Hampton City Council approves the annual budget. The budget presented in this document covers the period of July 1, 2010 through June 30, 2011.

FY11 Manager’s

Recommended Budget




MANAGER’S MESSAGE



Mayor Ward, City Council Members and Citizens:



Enclosed you will find the FY 2011 Manager’s Recommended Budget totaling $412,382,738, a 5.16%

decrease from the adopted FY 2010 budget. Of this grand total, the City Operations budget is $227,897,562

(0.79% increase) and the School System portion is $184,485,176 (11.61% decrease).



These numbers are slightly deceiving and do not, at first glance, convey the severity of the situation the City faced in this budget cycle. For instance, the total City revenue (before schools) appears to have slightly increased. Yet, a substantial amount of this total – $4.2 million – is not net available revenue that could be used to avoid budget cuts as it was dedicated revenue obligated to specific services. The following revenue amounts are in the projections but are linked with increased expenditure requirements,

meaning the total revenue available for discretionary use is overstated by the following amounts:



• State Social Services revenue for mandated programs



1,200,000

• Dedicated EXCEL revenues now received

in

the

General

Fund:

1,400,000

• Dedicated charges for services (EMS, Fishing Pier)



400,000

• Incremental 2+2 revenue dedicated to Convention Center

350,000

• Incremental Peninsula Town Center revenue to CDA



880,000

TOTAL REVENUE WITH EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS

4,230,000



While these revenues show up in the total revenue, they were not available for general uses. In essence,

this means the City budget actually experienced a true loss of revenue not readily apparent when looking

at the total budget. Additionally, the proposed budget includes approximately $1.4 million of increased

revenues associated with re-benchmarking existing user charges and the reintroduction of the boat

tax/RV tax. Had these changes not been introduced, the City’s operating budget would have shown a net

loss instead of the minor increase depicted in total figures.



Moreover, the City faced large state budget cuts and losses in general property tax revenues. State budget cuts for the City totaled $2,700,000 while real estate revenues were down $3,000,000. State cuts occurred in areas – such as per diem funds for jails – that could not be cut by a like amount. Thus, these losses – coupled with the revenues not available for general city services – put extreme pressure on the budget.



The expenditure side of the question was equally challenging. Although revenues were down, certain

expenditures continued to grow faster than inflation. City required VRS and health insurance increases

are but two examples of expenses which needed to be absorbed in the upcoming budget. Lease payments

for a new and much needed public safety radio system as well as some minor increases in debt service

were also required. As referenced above, there were certain areas of the budget – most notably Social

Services – in which funds were made available but required corresponding increases in spending. We also

began a phased effort to back away from full funding of the capital budget with one-time monies from

fund balance (the City’s savings account). While some use of fund balance is used in the recommended

budget, the amount is slightly reduced from past years. This is prudent as the fund balance in excess of

policy is diminishing. We also thought it prudent to plan for mid-year budget cuts from the State. This

practice has served us well as mid-year State budget cuts have become the rule rather than the exception.



In total, between revenue losses and expenditure pressures, the City faced a $19 million shortfall that has been resolved largely with expenditure reductions. However, it must be noted that as large as the City budget shortfall was and as painful as the cuts have been, the School System faced even greater

challenges. The actual revenue loss to the School System from state and federal funds was just over $23

million. The independently elected School Board made decisions on how to handle the required cuts to

cover these losses and the City Council adopts their budget as part of the City’s. However, when

combined with the City losses of state revenue, it should be apparent that the State’s decision-making has had very real and deep impacts on the entire Hampton community.



All of this is in the way of noting that this budget was exceptionally difficult to manage. In my twenty

years with the City, I have never seen a budget situation that was as challenging. And yet, as I read the

regional, state and national news, I must also note that our community has weathered the recession better

than most. Many cities and towns nationally are closing community centers, public libraries and other

municipal facilities. Other communities are having to reduce the number of first-responders like police

officers and firemen. While cuts to city services had to be made in this budget, we were able to avoid

these types of truly draconian reductions.



Hampton is blessed to have several economic projects that are coming to fruition at this critical time –

projects long-planned that will reap major dividends for the community and the budget. Indeed, new

revenues from the Peninsula Town Center are included in this proposed budget. The meals, sales and

admissions taxes paid at the Center were an instrumental factor in minimizing an even greater negative

impact on city services. The Hampton University Proton Beam Institute is also scheduled to come on-line

this year and will generate additional tax revenue in the future.



So while our challenges were – and remain – great, we should recognize and understand that the painful

cuts we are enduring could have been much worse.



I am pleased that I am able to deliver a budget which I believe makes required reductions in the least

damaging manner. This is not to say that the cuts are pain-free. On the contrary, all of the 78 permanent

full-time positions that are recommended for elimination were warranted and would

have been funded were the City’s economic position different. All of the operating budget cuts will be

felt by departments as they struggle to carry on business as usual. There will be occasions when citizens

may see a slight impact on service delivery. Certainly, there will be constituents who will bemoan the

reduction of an important service to them. However, I believe we have protected the core services of the

City to include police, fire, emergency management, infrastructure management, garbage collection, etc.

Further, in the areas where we did cut, we were able to “keep a pilot light” on so that the service

continues in some fashion and can benefit from reinvestment when the economy recovers.



I cannot overemphasize the importance of citizen input in this budget process. Over the last several

months, we have conducted the most extensive budget outreach the City has ever undertaken with regard

to the budget. We undertook this outreach because we understand that a budget should, as much as

possible, reflect citizen values. While all of our services are important, we understood that cuts needed to be made; that any cut we would offer would be disappointing to some; and, as a result, we needed to have as clear an understanding as possible about the services residents most wanted preserved.



While there is not a perfect correlation between the input received from citizens and our final

recommendations, the citizens’ voices and thumbprints are embedded throughout. For instance, in

addition to largely protecting police, fire and infrastructure management, this budget fully funds the

public library system. While most departments took cuts in this process, we exempted the library as

citizens spoke in near unanimity about the need to maintain funding levels for this critical service.



Youth prevention and early intervention services – were also held constant. While citizens valued these

programs, we also opted to preserve them largely because of clear evaluative data that establishes that

cuts in these efforts will result in larger long-term reactive services. We endeavored to not fall prey to the trap of being “penny wise and pound foolish” with regard to these important services.



Other services – as valued as they were – were identified as “wants” and not needs by citizens and thus

sustained larger cuts. For instance, the History Museum budget is reduced by 20% – an amount that will

be hard to manage but will be negotiated with the assistance of the Hampton History Museum

Foundation. Special events programming – again valued by residents but seen as a “want” – is scaled

back by 50%. The historical general fund subsidy of the Arts Commission and New American Theater

was also eliminated.



These are but a few examples of how citizen input shaped the development of this budget. Others are

highlighted below as we detail the various actions taken to close the $19 million budgetary shortfall:




Reduction in outside contracts/agencies – $780,000

This budget continues and accelerates Council’s past policy decision to back away from

funding charitable organizations that do not directly relate to government agencies. We have

City of Hampton





completely zeroed out funding for these agencies which had already been slated for loss of

funding. (A 75% cut had been scheduled for this year but was accelerated due to extreme fiscal

pressure.) Outside agencies which have a direct governmental connection (they provide

services the City would otherwise have to provide and/or minimize our caseloads) have been

level-funded. We have also reduced or eliminated funding to various other entities including

the Sister Cities program, Peninsula Sports Commission, Hampton Roads Regional Jail and the

Hampton Roads Military and Federal Facilities Alliance. In the case of the latter reduction, we

believe City’s commitment to funding a full-time military and federal facilities liaison is more

critical and produces a bigger return for us. Together, these changes generated $780,000 in

savings.



Reduction or deferral of capital projects – $3,600,000

We opted to delay certain additional capital projects funding in cases where there were existing

unexpended balances. Examples include but are not limited to the retail/shopping center

revitalization program; neighborhood improvement funding; blighted property

acquisition/demolition; and, strategic property acquisition.



Use of fund balance for one-time purchases/capital projects – $4,400,000

Due to past responsible financial planning, we were blessed to have close to $8.7 million in

excess fund balance over our already conservative 10% of budget requirement. This budget

recommends $4.4 million ($1.2 million less than FY 2010), or about half of that excess balance,

to cover one-time expenses in the budget. The bulk of the money will go to the capital budget

for preplanned CIP projects. Other funds will be used to fulfill commitments made to the Food

Bank, the Hall of Fame and the 2010 Celebration committee.



Employee Pay & Benefit Changes – $800,000

I am pleased we were able to avoid major changes to employee pay. This budget contains no

reduction in salary for the general work force and no furlough days. There are some minor

changes in health insurance co-pays and a minor health insurance premium increase which is

shared 50-50 with employees. Original budget projections had assumed a larger premium

increase. Also, through the offer of a one-time early retirement incentive, we were able to

generate additional savings. Positions vacated through this retirement incentive will either be

eliminated or replaced with new hires at the entry level of the pay range for the position. These

changes will generate a combined savings of roughly $800,000. There will be no general wage

or merit pay increases this year. In a sign of unity and leadership, the department heads of the

organization – along with me – have agreed to a voluntary one-time 2% salary reduction. This

2% reduction is equivalent to a whole week of pay.

Departmental/Service Mergers – $975,000

Several mergers and consolidations are proposed in this budget. I strongly believe that these

mergers position our organization and community for greater success at a reduced cost. While

there will be some immediate pain in the accompanying loss of 23 permanent full-time

positions, the new units should serve us well into the future. For instance, we are consolidating

the management of the 911 and 311 operations. Other communities have developed an effective

integration of the two systems while simultaneously recognizing the two distinctly different

call-taking environments. I am confident we can do the same while minimizing overhead in the

operations.



We are also consolidating all marketing functions currently dispersed in multiple departments

into a central operation. Not only will this move save dollars but it will also allow us to better

integrate our marketing and outreach efforts and enable us to continue the new, innovative

outreach methods we have employed during budget development for other critical city

projects.



All youth and families services currently dispersed in multiple city departments will be

consolidated into one central operation. The Youth Commission and Teen Center from the

Coalition for Youth; the InSync and Communities in Schools programs from the Neighborhood

Office; and the after-school School Age Programs from the Recreation Division will be

integrated with the Healthy Families Partnership into a new division of Youth, Education and

Families under the larger Human Services umbrella. This integrated structure will allow us to

offer a seamless approach to early intervention and prevention services for youth and families

and will save money at the same time.



Another major restructuring is the integration of the Planning Department, Codes Compliance

Department, Land Development Services Office and the Housing services component of the

Neighborhood Department into a new consolidated department of Community Development.

While this merger saves money as well, it is critically important to ensure that these services

are effectively managed under one consolidated leadership structure. Past service delivery

issues will be more effectively addressed with a streamlined command structure.



Last, but not least, I am very pleased to report that we will have one City-School System

consolidation. This budget proposes the consolidation of the two organizations’ cable television

operations. This merger will both achieve financial savings and allow a shared governance

board to better leverage our public education and government (PEG) channels for the

maximum benefit of the community.



When totaled, these mergers collectively generated $975,000 of savings.

Changing the Way We Do Business -- $530,000

A total of $530,000 in savings – and 7 permanent full-time position eliminations – has been

generated by a review of current operations. We will be contracting out some services which

were previously done by permanent full-time staff (ex. state and federal government

representation), transferring some administrative costs to the appropriate funds and creating

administrative pools for clerical services.



Organization-wide changes – $2,500,000

$2.5 million of savings was achieved by adopting some organization-wide changes such as

making reductions for attrition and related benefit savings; reductions in transfers to other

funds and indirect costs; reductions in non-departmental funds; and the suspension of the $1

million contribution to Hampton University for technological research. Also included in these

reductions is the elimination of the televised taping of the Holly Days Parade, which was

deemed a nicety and not a necessity.



Reducing the number of administrative overhead and management positions – $750,000

A priority area for reducing the permanent full-time workforce was in administrative overhead

and management positions. These types of jobs were targeted not because of a lack of

importance but rather out of a desire to protect front-line employees and service delivery as

much as possible. A total of 11 permanent full-time positions have been proposed for

elimination in this category for a savings, excluding benefits, of $750,000.



Reducing the number of administrative support positions -- $290,000

A total of 9 additional permanent full-time jobs are eliminated in this category for a savings,

exclusive of benefits, of $290,000. I reiterate that these positions, as well as those noted above,

are being eliminated out of economic necessity and not because of a lack of importance to the

organization. The elimination of these jobs will produce a greater workload for the remainder

of the workforce. However, given our budgetary picture, these jobs were deemed to be of a

lower priority than the ones which remain.



Elimination of vacant positions – $675,000

After reviewing management and administrative support positions, it was still necessary to

reduce some additional positions in order to balance the budget. Our priority then became

looking at vacant positions. Our desire here was to avoid layoffs and impacts to service

delivery as much as possible. A total of $675,000, exclusive of benefits, was saved through

these changes.



Reduction of Operating Costs – $830,000

A total of just under $830,000 was saved through a combined reduction of operating




City of Hampton ■ Office of Budget and Management Analysis

6





City of Hampton





funds throughout the City. Savings strategies included reductions in travel, office and

operating supplies and available hours for WAE (when actually employed, part-time) staff.



Service Eliminations/Reductions -- $850,000

After all of these changes, there were still some service reductions and/or eliminations that

needed to be made to balance the budgetary shortfall. Most of these have already been detailed

above. Additionally, we will streamline hours at our two aquatic centers, taking advantage of

different peak demand times at Old Hampton Community Center and the Aquatics Center

located in the Hamptons Golf Course and Teen Center complex. The Neighborhood Office

programs will be merged with new units as noted above and scaled back in remaining areas

such as capacity building. Extension Service programming, diversity operations and

programming and some recreation programs have also been scaled back but not completely

eliminated.



Total Benefit Savings from position eliminations – $1,000,000

In addition to the salary savings listed above, which reflect a total of 78 permanent full-time

positions, $1 million in associated fringe benefit costs were saved.



Increases in user fees and boat tax -- $1,400,000

Finally, we did include some minor changes in existing user fees and charges. Most of these

related to specific services for which the existing fee was either not recouping the full cost of

the service and/or out of alignment with regional localities existing rates. As an example, the

after-school program is self-supporting and, even after the slight increase, we will continue to

offer extremely affordable, quality programming for our students. Building permits, police

services and various other parks & recreation fees were also adjusted. This budget does include

for the first time a funeral escort fee for police services offered in conjunction with funerals.

Hampton is one of the only cities that does not currently charge for this service. Additionally,

this budget reintroduces the personal property tax on boats and recreational vehicles. The

value of existing boats in our community and their impact to our larger tax base has been

carefully evaluated. We believe a nominal rate of 30 cents will enable us to recover some of the

costs associated with servicing the boater community (ex. police and fire boat services) while

not setting an effective tax so large that boaters will feel forced to leave our community.



Altogether, these fourteen budgetary strategies generated just over $19 million to close our budgetary

gap. These strategies and funds have enabled us to give the community a balanced budget without a real

estate or other major tax increase. The most challenging aspect of this budget

is the impact on our work force. All of the people who happen to be in jobs we will cut are good, hard—

working employees. The most painful part of these downsizing decisions is knowing that wonderful

people who put their hearts and souls into their jobs each and every day get hurt. Let me assure you that




City of Hampton ■ Office of Budget and Management Analysis

7





City of Hampton





we will all do everything we can to help these employees make a smooth transition into new jobs and

continued service.



As for the impacted employees, we will do all we can to place them into jobs for which they are qualified

and interested. I am encouraged that, through our hiring freeze and retirement incentive, we already have

106 positions available to potentially place impacted employees into. By the time others complete their

retirement decision-making, it is quite possible that there will be more than twice the number of open and available jobs than the number of impacted employees.

Nonetheless, the next few weeks and months will be very stressful for our employees. Even as they are

placed into new positions, impacted employees will have major adjustments to make. I have reminded

the entire work force that we need to support each other. I also assured employees that we will get

through these tough times, especially if we all pull together. As I have said many, many times, we are a

great team. We can address any challenge we face as long as we do it together.

In closing, as previously stated, this budget required cuts. I truly believe we have made those tough

choices in the least damaging manner and in a way that is respectful of resident input. I want to publicly acknowledge and thank a wonderful group of department heads, assistant city managers and budget team for ensuring that this challenging budget accomplished these goals. I must also highlight a larger

group of employees who helped me shepherd in a whole new level of civic engagement around the

budget process. Our “I Value” campaign has been incredibly uplifting and insightful. To demonstrate the

impact of the citizen comments on this budget in an even more overt way, you will find that this budget

document features the names, voices and comments of our citizens. They have helped us to better

illustrate for you that this budget is indeed a reflection of community values – that the budget is far more than numbers. Instead, it is the reflection of the things that matter most to our community. I trust the City Council and community will enjoy and appreciate these expressions as much as I do.



We look forward to working with each of you to better understand this budget and its impacts on our

community and work force in the coming weeks. As always, we stand ready to assist you and the

community.



Sincerely,





Mary B. Bunting

governmental type funds including General Fund, Special Revenue Funds,

a. Real and personal property taxes are recorded as revenue

when levied and billed, net of allowances for uncollectible

amounts.

i. Property taxes not collected within 45 days after year-end are reflected as deferred revenue.

2. Revenues from federal, state and other grants are recorded at the

time of receipt of notification of grant.

3. Sales and utility taxes are collected by the State or the utility

company, generally in the month preceding receipt by the City.

ii. Expenditures, other than interest and principal on long-term debt, are

recorded when the liability is incurred.

iii. Interest and principal on long-term debt are recognized when due.

b. Accrual basis of accounting is followed in the Internal Service Funds and

Enterprises Funds.

i. Revenues are recognized when earned and expenses are recognized when

the related liability is incurred.




II.

Financial Accounting

a. Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) shows the status of the City’s

finances on the basis of “generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).

i. General Fund and School Operating Funds are legally adopted on a basis

DESCRIPTION OF BUDGETED FUNDS

These descriptions below explain the purpose of each of the funds listed in the “Summary of

Budgeted Funds” pages.

GOVERNMENTAL-TYPE FUNDS



The City’s adopted budget contains appropriations for four major and three non-major

governmental-type funds. The General Fund, Capital Improvement Fund, Debt Service Fund,

and the Economic Development Fund are all considered major governmental funds. There are

seven non-major governmental funds however, only three are appropriated and presented in

this budget: Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), EXCEL Fund, and Stormwater

Management. The modified accrual basis is used to budget all governmental-type funds.



General Fund

The General Fund accounts for all revenues and expenditures that are not required to be

accounted for in a special purpose fund. This funds’ revenue source is taxes and fees generated

at the local level, such as real estate, personal property, utility taxes, etc. The General Fund

finances most of the regular day to day operations of the City. The following descriptions refer

to individual General Fund appropriations transfers to other funds within the City.



 Transfer to Capital Improvement Fund is a fund that accounts for financial

resources to be used for acquisition or major construction of capital assets such as

land, buildings, parks, streets and roads. In order for expenditures to be eligible

for the capital budget, they must cost over $50,000, and have a life expectancy of

five or more years.



 Debt Service Fund is a fund that accounts for the accumulation of resources for and

the payment of general long-term debt principal and interest of the City. Primary

schools.



 Retirement and Employee Benefits are where the City’s budgeted fiduciary

obligations/activities are reported within the Retirement and Benefits section of

this budget document. The City excludes these activities from the City’s

government-wide statements because the City cannot use these assets to finance

its operations. The City is the trustee, or fiduciary for its employees’ pension

plans: Hampton Employees Retirement System (HERS) and the Virginia

Supplemental Retirement System (VRS).



 Transfers to Other Funds are inter-fund transfers (appropriations) involving the

budgeting of money from one fund to another in order to support the functions to

be carried out by the receiving fund. General Fund transfers to other funds may

be made for operating as well as capital purposes.

are Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Fund, Economic Development Fund,

Emergency 911 Fund, and EXCEL Fund.

awarded to the City annually from the Department of Housing and Urban

Development. CDBG funds are used to complement other resources in the

implementation of the Healthy Neighborhoods Initiative.

rents, established for public improvement projects or purchases and acquisition of

land in support of Economic Development efforts.

PROPRIETARY-TYPE FUNDS



These departments are accounted for on a similar basis as a private business. The City

maintains two types of propriety funds; Internal Service and Enterprise Funds. These funds are

budgeted using the full accrual basis for budgeting.



Internal Service Funds

These funds are used to account for the financing of goods or services provided by one

department or agency to other departments or agencies of the City, on a cost reimbursement

basis. The Internal Service Fund departments include Fleet Management, Information

Technology, and Risk Management.



 Fleet Management Fund accounts for the operations of the City’s central automotive

maintenance service facility.

 Information Technology Fund accounts for the costs of providing the following services:

personal computer support, printing, mailing and telecommunications services.

 Risk Management Fund accounts for the costs of providing insurance coverage and

certain self-insured liabilities of the City and the School Board.



Enterprise Funds

Enterprise Funds operate in a manner similar to private businesses in which operating

expenses are completely or partially recovered from income collected from user fees charged to

the general public. The Hampton Roads Convention Center, The Hamptons Golf Course, and

the Wastewater Management Fund are considered major Enterprise Funds. The non-major

funds are the Coliseum, Woodland Road Golf Course, Solid Waste Fund, and the Steam Plant.

For presentation purposes, the Solid Waste, Steam Plant, and the Wastewater funds are

FINANCIAL POLICIES

General Fund

The City Council adopted a set of financial parameters to guide future City expenditure patterns.

These financial policies and their compliance with the approved budget are outlined in this section.



City Tax Revenue Guideline

City Council approved a guideline for budget development in which real estate tax revenue growth

(net of new construction) from one fiscal year to the next shall be limited to the equivalent

percentage increase of an inflationary growth factor as measured by either the consumer price

index for urban dwellers (CPI-U) or resident income growth (RI); whichever is greater in any given

year. To the extent that budgetary needs require real estate revenues to grow faster than this

factor, the Manager and Council shall explicitly explain the budget driving factors causing this so

that residents may have a concise and clear understanding of the need to deviate from this financial

guideline.



For FY 2011, the real estate assessment growth is expected to average 0.15%. This growth is below

the guidelines established by City Council and therefore, the guideline stated above was not applied

to the Fiscal Year 2011 Budget.



City Financial Policy

In April 2007, the City Council amended its existing financial policies. The financial policies relate

to general operating elements of the City. These policies are used as financial planning parameters

during the annual budget process. The five (5) financial polices and the actual results are

summarized below. The City’s FY11 Manager’s Recommended Budget is in compliance with all five

policies.



1. Debt Limit Policy #1. This policy is comprised of three guidelines as outlined below:

(a) General obligation debt shall not exceed 3% of the assessed value of all real estate within

the City subject to taxation. The legal debt limit authorized by the Virginia State Statute

limits bond issuing authority up to 10% of the assessed value. The FY11 estimated general

obligation debt will total $316.0 million or 2.8% of taxable real estate value

($11,366,916,992), which is within the policy parameter.

(b) General obligation bonded debt together with indirect debt, which includes certain

revenue backed debt and subject-to-appropriation or moral obligation commitments, and

debt of certain special purpose entities (i.e. Community Development Authority) shall not

exceed 4.5% or $556.6 million of the estimated FY11 assessed value of all real and

personal property subject to taxation within the City. The current level of net

FY11 Council



Approved Budget




FINANCIAL POLICIES

direct/indirect/overlapping debt is $530.4 million or 4.3% of the assessed value of all

taxable real and personal property which is within the policy parameter.

(c) Debt of certain special purpose entities, such as community development authorities, shall

not exceed 1% of the assessed value of all real and personal property subject to taxation

within the City. The expected amount is $102.3 million or 0.08% of the approximate FY11

assessed value of all taxable real and personal property, which is within the policy

parameter.

2. Debt Service Limit Policy #2. General obligation bonded debt and indirect debt shall not

exceed 10% or $42.3 million of the City’s total General Fund, School Operating Fund and

Convention Center expenditures of which all are included in the City’s total debt service. The

total annual debt service cost equals $38.5 million or 9.1% of total expenditures, which is

within the policy parameter.

3. Debt Retirement Policy #3. The City shall retire 60% of the principal balance of general

bonded obligation debt within 10 years of the date the debt is issued. The City will retire

approximately $211.6 million or 67% of general bonded obligation debt by FY2021, which is

within 10 years.

4. Equity Funding Policy #4. This policy is comprised of two guidelines as outlined below:

(a) A minimum of 2% to 6% of general fund revenues will be applied to Capital Improvement

Plan (CIP) projects each year. For FY11, the percentage of revenues utilized for capital

expenditures are estimated to be $11.0 million which is 3.7% of General Fund revenues.

(b) A minimum of 10% to 15% of CIP projects over a rolling five-year period are to be funded

from general fund revenues. For the five year period, FY11 through FY15, the City plans

to use an estimated $59.8 million or 37.2% of General Fund revenues on CIP projects.

5. Undesignated Fund Balance Policy #5. The City will maintain an undesignated General

Fund balance equal to 10% of total General Fund and School Operating Fund revenues less

School transfers. For FY11, those estimated revenues are expected to total $408.1 million.

The undesignated fund balance at June 30, 2010 is forecasted to be $49.5 million or 12.1%

which is in compliance with this policy. To the extent undesignated fund balance falls below

the policy, the shortfall shall be replenished over a three-year period.



The City is in compliance with the Financial Policy Guidelines.

CREDIT RATINGS

The City’s credit ratings are as follows: AA by Standard and Poor’s, Aa2 by Moody’s Investor

Services and AA by Fitch Rating.

REVENUE DESCRIPTIONS





Machinery & Tool Tax is a personal property tax levied on tangible business machinery and tools. The

current rate is $3.50 per $100 of assessed value. The estimated revenues for FY11 are $1,988,680, which remains flat over FY10.



Public Service Tax is levied on real estate and tangible property owned by businesses required to register with the State Corporation Commission such as telephone companies, railroads, utility companies, etc.

Current real property is assessed at fair market value for public service corporation properties as of

January 1 of each year. These revenues are expected to increase $111,754 over FY10.



Other General Property Revenues consist of delinquent real estate and personal property tax revenues from previous years along with refunds, penalties, and mobile home taxes totaling $6,142,835, an increase of $109,711 over FY10 mainly due to an expected increase in real estate tax collections and BID taxes.

Personal property tax collection is expected to be close to 96%.




Other Local Revenues




Utility Tax - Electric & Gas: Effective January 1, 2001, the City was given authority by the State to impose and levy a monthly tax, on a "per meter" basis, on each purchase of natural gas (delivered by pipeline) and electricity. This tax is collected by the service provider from the consumers. The total revenues for FY11 remain constant at $4,875,000. The current rates for residential, commercial, industrial and all other consumers are listed in the Tax and Fee Rates section of this document.

REVENUE DESCRIPTIONS



Other Local Taxes Collected is the remaining local taxes not previously mentioned including; bank

stock taxes, motor vehicle license taxes, license fees-para mutual, recordation taxes, short term rental

taxes, and tobacco taxes. The combined total for these revenues is $9,434,730 in FY11. There is a

projected decline of $200,000 in Tobacco Tax revenue based on current trends. The motor vehicle license

tax is expected to increase over $671,730 due in part to the $2 increase in this tax resulting in $190,000 in additional revenues.




License, Permit & Privilege Fee




These revenues are generated from various activities within the City primarily from the growth of

construction by issuance of building plans; and electrical and plumbing permits to ensure the quality and

appearance of the City along with the safety of our citizens. Other fees are collected for animal licenses, street and taxi permits, zoning and land fees. The projected revenues total $1,215,920 which is 22.4%

over FY10 primarily due to various fee increases in this category. The following fees will increase in

FY11: Taxi Permits, Tow Truck Inspections, Taxi Inspections, Wide Load Hauling Permits and Building

Permits and ABC Privilege license fees, resulting in $150,000 additional revenues in this category. In

most cases the existing fee was not recouping the full costs of the service or the fee was out of alignment with regional locality rates.




Fines and Forfeitures




These collections are the results of charges ordered by the courts for violations of the City ordinances.

These revenues are expected to have a slight decrease from $1,973,350 to $1,954,350 for FY11.




Revenues from Use of Money & Property




Interest earned on investments generates the majority of the revenues in this category. Due to economic

and market conditions, FY11 estimated interest income is expected to recover some but is still

significantly under historical trends. FY11 estimated rates move from 0.5% to 1% with a projected

decrease of $196,900 in Interest from Investment revenues. Revenue from Billboard Advertising has

been earmarked to the General Fund by Council and is expected to bring in an additional $60,000 for

FY11.

REVENUE DESCRIPTIONS





Charges for Services




This category consists of revenues from fees charged by court officers, the Sheriff’s department,

recreation, ambulance services, Healthy Start Programs, Healthy Family Partnership Classes, Library

fines/fees, legal services, landfill host fees and miscellaneous fees. FY11 revenues in this category

increased approximately 18.4% bringing total revenues collected in this category to $7,039,181. The

majority of this increase is due to rate increases in the School Age Program along with reinstituting the

registration fee; fees collected from the operation of the Buckroe Pier; a $238,542 increase in the EMS

fees from fee increases implemented in FY10; and the implementation of a Funeral Escort Fee expected to

bring in $92,000. In addition to the above mentioned increases this category suffered a $75,000 decrease

due to the State ending their contract with the Sheriff’s Office for prisoner labor.




Miscellaneous Revenues




This category includes School service reimbursements, payment in lieu of taxes, indirect cost from other

funds to the general fund, recovered costs, and other revenues not classified in any other category. This

year’s budget will reflect an additional $129,000 for a new Administrative fee related processing of

paperwork for Extra Duty Pay for Officers and an additional $176,766 mainly due to the addition of one

School Resource Officer for one of the new schools opening this fall. The total estimated revenue for this category for FY11 is $4,569,036 which is a $489,811 increase over FY10.




Unrestricted State Revenues




Non-categorical aid received from Virginia for the City’s share of taxes levied on vehicle rental, mobile

home titling, and deeds make up this category. The estimated revenue for this category is $644,351 which

is a 17.2% decrease from FY10. The State of Virginia expects to collect less vehicle rental taxes based on a smaller tax base due to economic conditions.

REVENUE DESCRIPTIONS





State Revenues for City/State Departments




This category consists of shared-expenses in which the State provides funding assistance for the

Constitutional Officer’s salaries/wages as determined by the State Compensation Board on an annual

basis; funds for the elected official offices include Clerk of Circuit Court, Commissioner of Revenue,

Commonwealth’s Attorney, Electoral Board, Voter Registrar, Treasurer, Social Services, Sheriff’s Office

and Jail. For FY11, the category was offset by anticipated net State reductions in revenues of $1,438,000.

Funding, for these programs, is affected by the Governor’s 2011-2012 Biennial Budget. The estimated

total decrease is $488,486, partly due to a reduction in staffing of six PFT positions passed by the VA

Compensation Board, to $24,822,015 for FY11.




State Revenue for City Departments




This section includes categorical State and Federal funding. The City’s police department recovers some

of its costs from the “599 funds” distributed by the Commonwealth of Virginia. The Virginia Governor’s

Biennial Budget 2011-2012 included a 9% reduction in “599” fees resulting in a revenue decrease of

$674,071. For Street & Highway Maintenance revenues, the Virginia Department of Transportation has

appropriated $12,561,396 for FY11, an increase of $122,916 over FY10.




School Funds from Other than City




State funding for education represents the largest categorical aid received by the City from the

Commonwealth of Virginia. The State Funds are revenues received based on a formula comprised of a

ratio of the number of school age children within the City compared to the number of school-aged

children statewide. The State has appropriated $85,088,345 for FY 2011 which is a decline of

$17,989,219 or 21.2% due to economic conditions in the state. The State Lottery Profits dedicated for the purpose of public education is estimated to decrease 38.7% in FY11 to $11,009,667.



Other Funds include miscellaneous revenues such as fees from students, tuition from day students,

Medicare reimbursement and interest earnings. Revenues are expected to increase to $1,133,000.

The federal government also provides aid under Public Law 874 to assist local schools systems for the

number of federal employees including military families by providing financial assistance for school

construction and operations. The total revenues are expected to decline to $1,294,754.



Of the Share 1% Sales Tax collected by the State for sales and use taxes, the City contributes the entire 1% to the Hampton City Schools. This amount will decrease by $942,413 to $18,907,934.




General Fund Balance




Each year the City allocates a specific portion of undesignated fund balance to be used for one-time

operational costs in the proceeding fiscal year. This amount designated shall comply with the City’s

financial policies regarding undesignated fund balance. For FY11, a total of $4,407,963 will be

appropriated from fund balance. One time funding items totals $457,963 and Capital Budget totals

$3,950,000.



Transfer from School Operating Fund




The Hampton City School Board has agreed to contribute $2,000,000 from their operating fund to the

City’s debt service reserve for the future debt service repayment on the general obligations bonds issued

for school construction.

The net increase is attributed to the additions for

Peninsula Town Center incremental taxes, Coliseum

BIDs and the elimination of funding for those

PURPOSE OF DEPARTMENTAL BUSINESS TEAMS



The Fiscal Year 2011 budget process brought a number of challenges, with the major challenge

being a $19.4 million budget shortfall. This projected shortfall necessitated a closer review and

subsequent reorganization of the City’s departmental business teams.

Two teams have been restructured to include vital services that were repositioned to facilitate

the most effective provision of services to Hampton citizens. The former “Arts, Culture and

Recreation” business team is now the “Leisure Services” business team and includes the

Hampton History Museum; the Hampton Public Library; and the Recreation division of the

Parks department.

The “Economic Vitality” business team is now merged with the former “Neighborhood and

Housing” business team to create the “Economic Vitality and Neighborhoods” business team.

This includes the Assessor of Real Estate; Community Development which absorbed the

services of both the Codes Compliance and Planning departments; the Convention and Visitor

Bureau; and Economic Development.

The initial areas of focus that the City Council deemed critical in 2006 are continued in the

seven business teams presented in this budget:



Constitutional, Judicial and Electoral Offices



Economic Vitality and Neighborhoods



Infrastructure



Leisure Services



Public Safety



Quality Government



Youth and Families



The City Manager and staff continue their commitment to present the budget according to key

business team areas. As city departmental budgets are presented in the business area for which

they have the most direct link, it is important to note, however, that many departments

contribute to more than one business area.

Business teams focus the City’s organization on the initiatives selected by their elected and

appointed leaders.



City of Hampton ■ Office of Budget and Management Analysis

City of Hampton

FY11 Council

Approved Budget

PURPOSE OF DEPARTMENTAL BUSINESS TEAMS (continued)

They are facilitated by the City Manager and the Assistant City Managers to achieve an

interconnectedness that is critical in today’s operating environment. Business team

management enhances financial control and long-range planning by requiring that all

departments focus not only on their individual needs but also on the needs of the business unit

as well. The teams are expected to develop annual and long-range goals; integrate departmental

plans to key business unit plans; share resources across departmental lines as necessary;

eliminate disparity in the application of organizational policies; and most of all, make a positive

and substantial contribution to the attainment of the City’s mission statement – to be the most

livable city in Virginia.

Increasing demands for services with dwindling revenues from the federal and state

governments compels us to tighten financial and operational control in the organization. The

clustering of departments into key business units accomplishes that. More importantly,

however, business team management will allow us to be better prepared for future challenges

such as homeland security; human self-sufficiency development; and redevelopment. No one

department acting in isolation can prepare our citizens or community for these challenges – it

takes a strongly coordinated and integrated effort on the part of multiple departments and

outside entities to achieve what our community will need in the future.

The General District Court handles most traffic cases, tries misdemeanors and conducts preliminary hearings on felonies. It also tries civil cases involving amounts of up to $15,000. The goal of the court is to consistently promote a positive image of the court system.

The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Virginia adopted a policy that “no litigant should have to wait more than one hour for their case to be called on the day of the hearing”. The General District Court, in an effort to comply with this policy, established a segmented docket schedule. Specific types of cases are set on certain dockets to be heard at different times during each day. The court limits the number of cases that are set for trial on the criminal and civil dockets and monitors the number of cases set on the traffic dockets to better meet with this policy. The Court continues to provide excellent customer service to the citizens of Hampton and the Commonwealth of Virginia.

relate to better organizational alignment. Thirteen (13) full-time positions as well as the associated

operating funds for Blue Bird Gap Farm, Buckroe Fishing Pier and Sandy Bottom Nature Center are

being transferred into the Recreation Division so that all leisure-time services are accounted for in this Division. These are transfers and not increases in services. Three (3) full-time positions as well as associated part-time and operating funds are being transferred to the Youth, Education and Families

Services budget as we moved the School-Age After School and Summer Programs for better

organizational alignment. Eleven (11) full-time positions are actually eliminated from this budget due to

reductions in the amount of administrative overhead, the elimination of the Outdoor Recreation/Climbing

Wall Service, and reduction in the hours of the City pools.

Management; transferring three fleet mechanical positions to Fleet Services during fiscal year 2010 and a

reduction in Other Salaries. The net increase in Operating Expenses is due to an increase in fixed costs

which now reflects a full year of expense costs for maintaining the fire fleet of vehicles and transferring the operating costs of the emergency management function to the new department.

Budget Note: By nature, it is difficult to predict in advance how these monies will be used since it

is included for unanticipated requirements. In prior years, uses have included supplemental

funding for jails, equipment purchases for courts and other City/State offices, legal fees and

unexpected revenue shortfalls. The increased funding in Contingency is the result of funds set

aside for a possible State revenue shortfall in Fiscal Year 2011. Even with this significant increase,

Contingency is funded at less than one-percent of the City's budget excluding School funding. It is

standard practice for contingencies to be funded at two to four percent of the budget. There are no

actual expenditures for FY07-FY09 because Contingency funds are transferred to other

departments where the actual expenditure has occurred.

Budget Note: There are substantial changes in this budget resulting from an effort to consolidate and streamline all organizational communications functions into one operation. Five (5) positions are being transferred in from Economic Development, Information Technology and the Neighborhood Office. As a result of the merger, two (2) positions directly tied to Media Relations can be eliminated from this budget.

Additionally, because the new team will report directly to the City Manager, the Special Assistant to the City Manager position which used to oversee this function can be transferred out to cover responsibilities. That position will be transferred back into the City Manager’s Office to cover the duties of the prior Director of Intergovernmental Relations since that position is being eliminated. We will also be consolidating our cable television operations with the school operations. Four (4) full-time positions will be impacted by this change.

When all of these changes are made, there is a net loss of two (2) positions.

Budget Note: This is a maintenance level budget. $75,000 is being reduced from the CSB so that the City

can directly fund prevention services. In FY 1989, the City gave the CSB funds for prevention services. This year the CSB opted to cease channeling part of the City’s contribution to the prevention funding.

Accordingly, we are making the necessary reduction to reflect actual CSB operational funds and maintain

the City’s long-standing commitment to prevention services. Through a partnership with the Social Services Division to serve TANF recipients in need of CSB services, we believe the CSB will be able to absorb this adjustment without any impact on its other clientele. It should be noted that the $75,000 is not a full

restoration of funds the CSB had provided to Alternatives but it is the amount the CSB agrees they can

absorb through the TANF partnership.

We are streamlining all Youth, Education and Families services into a consolidated unit. Services previously provided by the Neighborhood Office for youth and families (specifically In-SYNC and Communities in Schools) will be transferred in as will the School Age Programs (previously in the Recreation budget) and the Teen Center. By integrating all of these services with the existing Healthy Families Partnership programs (Healthy Start and Healthy Communities), we believe we will be offer a seamless continuum of prevention and early intervention services for youth and families. The net positions shown are transfers resulting from the

organizational consolidation and not increases in services. Transfers out are reflected in the departments impacted.

RETIREMENT AND BENEFITS DESCRIPTIONS



Accrued Payroll

The City pays its employees on a biweekly basis during the fiscal year which begins July 1st and

ends June 30th. For General Fund departments, any pay days within the first pay period of the

fiscal year that relate to the month of June is (accrued) charged back to the closing fiscal year.

The total amount accrued is charged against this accrued payroll account instead of the

individual departments’ salary expense line-item. This satisfies the principles of the modified

accrual basis of accounting that the City uses.



Compensation: Pay and Minimum Wage Adjustments and Sustained

Performance Program

The City appropriates monies for mid-year promotions and position upgrades in order to retain

successful employees and stay in-line with comparable market ranges. This budget line-item is

also the funding source for federally imposed minimum wage adjustments and the City’s

Sustained Performance Program for Master Officer, Senior Police Officers, etc.



Hampton Employees Retirement System (HERS) Contribution

HERS is a City provided retirement plan that was designed to supplement the retirement of

those City employees eligible for participation in the Virginia Supplemental Retirement System

(VRS). HERS covers all full-time salaried employees who were first hired prior to July 1, 1984.

The City is required to contribute an actuarially determined rate which currently is 15.85%

(FY09 rate) of annual covered payroll. For FY11, the estimated increase for HERS is $98,000.



Hospitalization Insurance (Self Insured)

Currently, the City offers one medical plan; Anthem Blue Cross/Blue Shield KeyCare (PPO

plan) to all eligible active and qualified retired employees. For FY11, approximately 82% of

eligible City employees participate in the plan. This plan is supported by the City and its

subscribers. For active employees, the City’s premium portion averages approximately 71% and

the employee’s share averages approximately 29% depending on the type of employee coverage.

For FY11, the estimated increase in premiums is expected to be 4.5%. This 4.5% will be applied

to both the City and employee’s share. In addition, to the rate increase the plan’s co-pays will

change. Office visit co-pays have increased to $20.00 for a primary care visit and $40.00 for a

specialist visit; prescription co-pays have increased for tier two and tier three drugs (generic co-

pay remains the same): $10/$30/$50; and the annual out of pocket maximum has increased to

$2,500 per individual and $5,000 per family. These changes will go into effect August 1, 2010.

Legislation permitting children up to age 26 to remain on their parents’ health plan takes effect

the beginning of the plan year following its effective date of September 23, 2010. For the City’s

plan, that means that this component of the legislation will not take effect until the plan year

beginning August 1, 2011. We are awaiting regulatory guidance on this and other aspects of

the legislation and will keep you informed as information becomes available. The City offers

vision and dental plans to its eligible employees and retirees however; all premiums are paid in

full by the enrollee through payroll deductions. The City of Hampton does not budget funds for

these plans.



Life Insurance

All eligible permanent full-time employees are automatically covered under the basic group life

insurance program provided by Minnesota Life for VRS members and retirees. The premium

costs are calculated as a percentage of the employee’s annual salary. Effective July 1, 2010, the

group life insurance rates decreased from 0.79% to 0.28% as approved by the Virginia Governor

and General Assembly. For FY11, the City will pay the entire life insurance premiums of 0.28%

for all eligible employees/retirees; the employees will no longer pay.




Other Fringe Benefits

This budget represents miscellaneous fringe benefits such as deferred compensation as a part of

the City Attorney, City Manager and Municipal Clerk’s compensation package.




Workmen’s Compensation (Self Insured)

The City is exposed to various risks of loss related to torts; theft of, damages to and destruction

of assets; error and omissions; injuries to employees and natural disasters. The City has an

established Risk Management Fund (Internal Service Fund) to account for and finance its

uninsured risk of loss and the cost of providing insurance coverage such as automobile, general

liability and workmen’s compensation. Since the City is self-insured this appropriation is

essentially a General Fund transfer to the Risk Management Fund to support this self-insured

liability of the City.

RETIREMENT AND BENEFITS DESCRIPTIONS



Separation Leave Pay

Employees who retire or separate from employment with the City are entitled to receive

payment for unused sick and vacation leave. According to Personnel Policies Manual, active

employees who are eligible for separation benefits have an established maximum number of

hours that can be paid out. Upon separation, other than retirement pay, employees will receive

sick leave pay of $20 per day up to a maximum of 720 hours. For retirees, sick leave is paid up

to 720 hours based on an hourly rate equivalent to one-half of the employee’s annual salary.

For both separating and retiring employees, vacation leave pay will be based on the employees

hourly rate on the date of separation up to the maximum accrual payout set forth in the

Personnel Policies Manual.




Social Security (FICA)

This is the employer portion of the Medicare tax obligations for all paid employees.

Contributions are calculated utilizing a combined rate for Social Security and Medicare (7.65%)

applied to a predetermined wage base.



Unemployment Insurance

The City pays unemployment tax on the first $8,000 of wages earned for each employee during

a calendar year. The percentage rate applied is computed by the Virginia Department of

Taxation. The City is estimated to pay approximately $100,000 in unemployment taxes for

Fiscal Year 2011.




Virginia Retirement System (VRS) Contribution

The City of Hampton contributes to the VRS, an agent and cost-sharing multiple-employer

defined benefit pension plan administered by the Virginia Retirement System. All full-time,

salaried employees of the City must participate in the VRS Plan. Members are required by Title

51.1 of the Code of Virginia (1950), as amended, to contribute 5% of their annual reported

compensation to VRS. The City of Hampton has assumed this 5% members contribution in

addition to the 15.34% required payment based on an actuarial basis specified by the Code of

Virginia and approved by the VRS Board of Trustees. The contribution rate for Fiscal Year 2011

is 20.34% of the estimated permanent full-time payroll.

Budget Note: This budget continues to fund the Sustained Performance Program, and funds for

position upgrades where there are retention or recruitment issues. In addition, the cost of a 4.5%

health insurance premium increase is funded. This increase will be shared equitably with

employees and reflects a change in co-pays to minimize the premium increases. Also increases for

Workmen's Compensation and funding for rate increases for both the Virginia Supplemental

Retirement System and Hampton Employees Retirement System are included in this budget.

DEBT MANAGEMENT POLICIES



The City maintains a separate Debt Service Fund that tracks long-term debt obligated for General

Fund activities. Debt activity for Enterprise, Internal Service, Special Revenue and Public Works

Funds are maintained in those individual funds. The Debt Service Fund accounts for the

accumulation of resources (monies) for and the payment of general obligation debt of the City.

Primary resources of the Debt Service Fund are derived from transfers from the General Fund and

the proceeds of any refunding bond issues.



The City borrows money by issuing bonds or notes. According to the City Code, bonds and notes in

anticipation of bonds may be issued for the purposes authorized by Council. The City issues this

debt in order to fund (pay for) projects within its Capital Improvement Program.



There are several reasons why the City may choose to borrow money: to fund current and future

needs; share the cost of a project with those utilizing the facility (project) in the future and to avoid

excessive cost burden on current taxpayers.



The City sometimes uses short-term obligations (e.g. Bond Anticipation Notes, Capital Leases, and

Line of Credit) to bridge the time gap between initiation of a project/purchase and the anticipated

bond issuance, when the nature of a purchase precludes the issuance of long-term debt, or when it

is fiscally responsible to do so. Prior to the issuance of any short or long-term obligations, the City

considers the effect on their financial position, the ability to repay, and the Commonwealth of

Virginia imposed legal debt limit.



Each fiscal year, the City of Hampton supports the acquisition, construction, renovation and

infrastructure maintenance stated in its five-year adopted Capital Improvement Plan. The capital

projects are funded from pay-as-you-go current revenues (general operating revenues), federal and

state revenues, appropriation from fund balance and the issuance of general obligation bonds. The

CIP provides a foundation to plan and structure debt in advance. The repayment period of the debt

should not exceed the expected useful life of the capital project for which the debt is incurred. In

doing so, specific sources are identified and dedicated to the retirement of debt. On April 11, 2007,

the City adopted a financial policy regarding the minimum amount of general fund revenues that

can be used to fund the CIP each year and over a rolling 5-year period. See the Financial

Summaries and Policies, section of this document.



The Council Proposed Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) for fiscal year 2011 includes a bond

issuance of $40.6 million for capital projects. This issuance includes $30.3 million for City capital

projects and $10.3 million for School Major Renovation and Maintenance. The Proposed CIP has a

total of $3,950,000 from General Fund Balance to be used to fund capital projects along with an

additional $3,023,393 from General Fund operating revenues. During fiscal year

DEBT MANAGEMENT POLICIES



2010, the City issued $72.78 million in bonds. This issuance included new General Obligation

Bonds totaling $20.0 million of which $12.9 million for City capital projects and $7.1 million for

Hampton City School projects. The remaining $58.7 million balance of the issuance was for the

Refunding (refinancing) of Bonds from the following years: 1998 Bonds, 2002 Bonds, 2002A Bonds,

2005A Bonds and 2007 Bond issuances.



The fiscal year 2011, the Hampton City School will continue to contribute $2,000,000 to pay for

part of the debt service attributed to the school major renovation and maintenance projects. The

City’s credit ratings are as follows: AA by Standard and Poor’s, Aa2 by Moody’s Investor Services

and AA by Fitch Rating. A credit rating is a financial indicator to the public/investor as to the

credit worthiness (quality) of a debt issue such as bonds. These agencies evaluate the City’s credit

risk based on the following areas: record of debt payments on time, consistent and strong revenue

growth; diverse, balanced revenue streams, reasonable, controlled expenditures, level of liquid

reserves (including fund balance) and strong financial planning. The highest credit ratings are Aaa

(Moody) and AAA (Standard & Poor’s). Both agencies have intermediate ratings and default

ratings of Ca, C (Moody) and D (Standard & Poor’s). The bonds with default ratings are more likely

unable to repayment of the debt.

DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS

This section contains information on the City’s debt service requirement for the next five years.

Debt service is similar to a mortgage; the City borrows funds by selling bonds and agrees to pay

the money back to the purchasers of those bonds over a 20 to 30 year period. These funds

received by the City are used for the acquisition, construction and renovation of public facilities

and infrastructure as well as major equipment purchases.

The rate of interest paid for borrowing these funds is determined by credit ratings from rating

agencies such as Standard and Poor’s, Moody’s Investor Service and Fitch Rating. The City’s

credit worthiness is rated similar to the credit ratings of an average citizen. The better the

score, the lower the interest rate charged on borrowing. The highest credit ratings are Aaa

(Moody) and AAA (Standard & Poor’s).

The City ensures that it does not borrow more than it can afford by adopting a set of financial

policies. For debt services the following policies apply:

 General obligation debt shall not exceed 3% of the assessed value of all real

estate within the City subject to taxation.

 General obligation bonded debt together with indirect debt, which includes

certain revenue backed debt and subject to appropriation or moral obligation

commitments, and debt of certain special purpose entities (i.e. Community

Development Authority) shall not exceed 4.5% of the estimated assessed value

of all real and personal property subject to taxation within the City (see section

on “Compliance with Financial Policies” for more detail).

In addition to the financial policies, repayment period of the debt should not exceed the

expected useful life of the capital project being funded. Included on the following schedules in

this section, is the payment of general bonded debt, literary loans and revenue bonds for the

Virginia Air and Space Museum.

DEFINITIONS OF VARIOUS TYPES OF DEBT

The City of Hampton’s debt service requirement includes the following debt instruments: Bond

Anticipation Notes (BANs), general bonded debt, school literary loans and debt associated with

land acquired using a Letter of Credit. Debt service requirements for the Enterprise, Internal

Service and Special Revenue funds are accounted for in that individual fund’s activity.

Bond Anticipation Notes

A municipal note issued to obtain temporary or short-term (one year or less) financing for

projects that will be repaid through the sale of bonds of a planned long-term bond issue.

Capital Lease

A Capital Lease is similar to a loan agreement for the purchase of a capital asset on

installments with fixed terms (number of months/years) and non-cancelable. The financing

company’s (lessor) services are limited to financing the asset; the City (lessee) pays all other

costs including insurance, maintenance, and taxes. Essentially, capital leases are considered a

sale by the lessor, and a purchase by the City (lessee), even though the title remains with the

lessor. Leased assets are capitalized and shown on the City’s balance sheet as a fixed asset with

a corresponding non-current liability (lease payable).

Debt Service

Debt Service refers to the amount of money necessary to pay principal and interest on

outstanding bonds or other debt. This amount, is also known as the debt service requirement ,

refers to the total principal and interest paid in a fiscal year and is referred to as the annual

debt service. “Total debt service” refers to the total principal and interest paid throughout the

life of a bond issue

General Bonded Debt

General Bonded Debt is long term obligation debt that is backed by the “full faith and credit”

pledge of the City’s general fund revenues.

Line-of-Credit

The City has borrowed money using a line of credit in order to quickly take advantage of an

opportunity to purchase physical assets such as real property acquisitions. Currently, the City

has one outstanding note from November 26, 2001, payable in annual installments through

November 26, 2011.

The City has adopted financial policies relating to the amount of outstanding debt; the amount

of overlapping debt; annual debt service costs and the payout ratio on general obligations

indebtedness. The Commonwealth of Virginia imposes a legal limit of 10% of assessed valuation

on the amount of general obligation borrowings which may be issued by the City. For more

details regarding the City’s policies on debt, refer to the Compliance with City Financial

Policies section of this document.

Literary Loans

In accordance with the Code of Virginia 22.1-146, Virginia State:

Board of Education may make loans or, subject to the approval of the General Assembly, loan

interest rate subsidy payments from the Literary Fund to the school boards of the several

school divisions making application therefore in the manner prescribed by law, authorized by

the governing body and the school board, for the purposes of (i) erecting, altering or enlarging

school buildings in such school divisions; (ii) purchasing and installing educational technology

equipment and infrastructure; (iii) equipping school buses for alternative fuel conversions and

for construction of school bus fueling facilities for supplying compressed natural gas or other

alternative fuels; and (iv) refinancing or redemption of negotiable notes, bonds, and other

evidences of indebtedness or obligations incurred by a locality on behalf of a school division

which has an application for a Literary Fund loan for an approved school project pending

before the Board of Education. For the purpose of this section, "alternative fuels" means motor

fuels other than gasoline and diesel fuel.

The City’s indebtedness includes loans from the State Literary Loan Fund. One loan was used

to fund the City’s share of the New Horizons Technical Center, a regional high school vocational

and technical center. The other loans were used for major repairs or renovations to four

elementary schools and Hampton High School. Repayment is annual installments over a 20—

year term at 3% interest from General Fund resources.

Revenue Bonds

The Hampton History Museum issued revenue bonds which are a special type of municipal

bond where repayment is solely from revenues generated from and associated with the

Hampton History Museum. Only those revenues specified in the legal contract between the

bond holder and bond issuer are required to be used for repayment of the principal and interest

of the bonds; other revenues such as property tax revenues are not so encumbered.

Budget Note: General Fund r evenues and General Fund Balance will be used to finance Capital Projects in FY11. The transfer to the Bass Pro Fund accounts for direct revenues generated by the store are set aside in an IDA account as part of the agreement between the City and Bass Pro, should they be needed. These funds were reduced in FY11 based on projected revenue estimates. The increase in EXCEL Fund reflects the transfer of Communication Tax revenues, which replaces Cable Franchise fee revenues previously dedicated to the EXCEL Fund. Cable Franchise fees no longer exist and have been replaced by a portion of the Communications Tax. Funding for The Hamptons Golf Course Fund has remained constant. The increase to

the Convention Center can be attributed to higher revenue estimates for both the meals and lodging taxes that are apportioned to the Convention Center Fund.

Budget Note: The local contribution to the Schools, which totals $67,051,476 for FY11, is based on an agreed upon formula in which they receive a predetermined percentage of the growth in residential general property and utility taxes.

The net reduction in the Commonwealth of Virginia's contribution to the School is approximately $23,227,631. The net decrease in the local contribution of $1,000,231 is the results of a decline in estimated revenues from real property taxes which is one of the drivers in the funding formula.

Relevant Excerpts from Chapter 781, 2009 Acts of Assembly, Regarding Budgeted Required Local Effort and Budgeted Required Local Match Item 140 A: 5. "Required Local Expenditure for the Standards of Quality" - The locality's share based on the composite index of local ability-to-pay of the cost required by all the Standards of Quality minus its estimated revenues from the state sales and use tax dedicated to public education and those sales tax revenues transferred to the general fund from the Public Education Standards of Quality/Local Real Estate Property Tax Relief Fund and appropriated in this Item, both of which are returned on the basis of the triennial census of school age population, as specified in this Item, collected by the Department of Education and distributed to school divisions in the fiscal year in which the school year begins.

CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PLAN POLICIES



Purpose



The purpose of the Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) is to provide a structured process for funding major

acquisitions, improvements and new construction projects in the City of Hampton. Generally, projects included in the CIP must have a useful life of at least five years and initial costs in excess of $50,000.




Financial Policy Statements



The financial parameters for pay-as-you-go funding for capital improvement projects are that no less than two percent (2%), but no more than six percent (6%) of estimated revenue for the annual operations of the City, less Schools, shall be devoted to capital expenditures. The total estimated General Fund operating revenues for fiscal year 2011 is $295,069,257. To adhere to this policy, contributions from the General Fund (GF) which include General Fund Balance Transfer, General Fund Operating Revenues and Urban Maintenance Contributions cannot be less than $5,901,385 and no more than $17,704,155. For fiscal year 2011, the total amount of funds being transferred from the General Fund to the capital projects fund is $11,008,393 or 3.7%) which is within the City financial parameters.



A second tier to the City’s financial policy was adopted on April 11, 2007 by City Council and states a

minimum of 10% to 15% of the total capital improvement expenditures over a rolling five year period shall be funded from General Fund revenues. The five year CIP totals $160,548,479 and the 10% to 15% minimum to be funded from General Fund revenues is equal to $16,054,848 and $24,082,272, respectively. The City

anticipates funding $59,779,809 or 37.2% from General Fund revenues. This amount is in compliance with the policy parameters.



While current revenues provide funding for some capital projects, other revenues are received from Federal and State sources such as the Congestion Mitigation Air Quality (CMAQ) Funds, Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP) and Urban Development Action Grant (UDAG) Funds. However, over the next five year

period, a large portion of financing will mainly come from the issuance of General Obligation Bond proceeds.

For financial policies regarding the maximum amount of debt that the City can issue, refer to the Compliance

with City Financial Policy section of this document.



It is the long-term goal of the CIP Committee to use pay-as-you-go funding for annual, recurring maintenance-type projects and use funding from General Fund Balance for construction and Economic Development projects. Bond proceeds are used to fund major one-time only capital expenditures and limit the amount of

public funds designated for new projects/new construction.

CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PLAN POLICIES



CIP Process



Each year, as part of the annual budget process, the City Council updates its five-year forecast for capital improvements. Based on the requests made by various City departments, community groups and revenue projections, the CIP Committee makes a recommendation to the Planning Commission, City Manager and City

Council identifying those capital projects being changed, added, or deleted and new projects that have become a high priority.



Capital projects include such items as road extensions and intersections, new construction of public facilities, maintenance of existing facilities, and the acquisition of land for future public use. The CIP projects are classified into one of ten categories:

 Education

 New Facilities

 Hampton’s Waterways

 Other CIP Projects

 Maintenance of Public Properties

 Other Economic Development Support

and Performance Support

 Public Safety

 Master Plans

 Streets & Infrastructures

 Neighborhood Support



The CIP is adopted by City Council at a public hearing by ordinance. The first year of the plan is adopted as the Capital Budget for the current fiscal year after some modifications by formal resolution. A separate Capital Improvement Plan document is prepared each year which contains the expenditures and revenues forecasted for the five-year period.



Operating Budget Impact



Some projects outlined in this plan have a direct impact on the City’s operating budget once the project is acquired or completed. This impact may require ongoing expenses for staff, other operating costs and capital outlays. Refer to the schedule in the following Capital Budget section regarding those projects and the anticipated impact on future operating budgets. Projects funded through debt financing (typically Council

authorized) also impact the operating budget through ongoing debt service expenses. Refer to the Debt Service

section in this document.

CAPITAL BUDGET IMPACT

ON OPERATING BUDGET

During the fiscal year 2011 capital budget development process, the City of Hampton took a very conservative approach to recommending capital projects for funding. The goal was to minimize, as much as possible, the fiscal impact these projects would have on the operating budget, including the debt service payments. This practice has been commonplace amongst many localities in response to the current economic climate.

The City's Financial Policies, which were approved by the City Council, allows for a certain percentage of General Fund revenues to be used in funding capital projects. However, the matter of affordabilityversus debt capacity was the sobering factor that contributed to the funding decisions put forth. Adding to an already challenging task is the fact that Hampton is undergoing implementation of a Master Plan which is designed to foster economic growth in housing, employment and retail.

The capital projects that were recommended and subsequently approved for funding represents those which the City has either a core responsibility in fulfilling or those for which the City would sustain adverse financial impact if funding were not continued. Certain of these project have an impact on the City's operating budget and is listed below.

The review of revenue options was an intricate part of the City's Fiscal Year 2011 budget balancing strategy. As such a group of employees was tasked with reviewing fees and taxes charged to users and to suggest areas for tax and fee increases or the establishment of new fees. Comparability to other cities was a definite factor used to determine which fees or taxes could be increased. The following tax and fee increases are the result of the work of this employee group.

Notes: The City of Suffolk has four tax zones, with real estate tax rates ranging from $.94 to

$1.34. Per Suffolk staff, the majority of its citizens are levied at the $.94 rate. In FY 1994-95,

Suffolk changed its method of appraising personal property from using 50% of retail value to

using loan value, which is generally lower than retail value. The loan value method is used by

other Hampton Roads Communities.

The City of Chesapeake has a base real estate tax rate of $1.04 and a base personal property

tax rate of $4.00. However, the rates are increased by $.01 and $.08, respectively, for mosquito

control.
