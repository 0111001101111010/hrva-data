Major Tax & Fee Rate Changes



 The Real Estate Property Tax Rate remains unchanged at $1.04/$100 assessed value.



 The Motor Vehicle License fee is recommended to increase from $28.00 to $30.00

(up to two tons) and from $33.00 to $35.00 (over two tons) and will be effective January 1, 2011.



 For FY 2011 there are recommended increases in various fees within the following areas of City operations; assessment and collections, police services, parks and recreation and building permits. Most of these rates relate to specific services for which the existing fee was not recouping the full cost of the services or the fee was out of alignment with regional locality rates. A complete listing of these fee increases can be reviewed in the FY11 Council Approved Budget under the “Tax and Fee

Recommendations” section available online or in the public libraries.

 All other major taxes and fees remain the same.



Budget Challenges



 Committed Revenues ($4.2M): The total City revenue (before schools) appears to have slightly increased; yet, a substantial amount of this total – $4.2 million – is not available revenue that could be used to avoid budget cuts. It is revenue obligated to specific services such as state mandated programs ($1.2M); dedicated EXCEL

revenues ($1.4M); CDA revenues for the Peninsula Town Center ($880,000); incremental 2+2 revenues for Convention Center ($350,000) and dedicated charges for services such as EMS fee and Fishing Pier ($400,000). While these revenues show up in the total revenue, they were not available for general uses. In addition to the obligated revenues, the City faced large State budget cuts of $2.4 million and a reduction in real estate tax revenues of $3.0 million.



 The expenditure side incorporates several required expenditures such as:



* Debt Service ($1.42M): This represents the projected increase for the repayment of bond principal due in FY 2011.



* Employee Benefits ($1.34M): The City is required to budget for the 1.89%

increase rate for VRS and a flat dollar amount of $98,000 for HERS retirement plans. The health insurance premiums increased approximately 4.5% for FY11.



* New Radio System ($1.84M): Funding for the payment of the lease purchase for the new public safety radio system is funded in the proposed capital budget.



 In total, between revenue losses and expenditure pressures, the City faced a $19.4

million shortfall that was resolved largely by expenditure reductions.
