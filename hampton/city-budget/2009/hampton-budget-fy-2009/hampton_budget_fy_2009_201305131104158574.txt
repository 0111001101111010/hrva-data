The Government Finance Officers Association of the United States and Canada (GFOA)

presented a Distinguished Budget Presentation Award to the City of Hampton, Virginia

Organizational Policy Framework



The City of Hampton’s budget and its budget process are essential links in an integrated

management approach to municipal service delivery. This approach coordinates the political,

legal and administrative procedures by focusing the organization on critical issues and programs

necessary for community success. The budget is one annual building block in this

comprehensive administrative process. The process includes the use of the Hampton Community

Plan (update February 8, 2006); the annual operating goals established by City Council, the

budget preparation and implementation processes, departmental planning work and the

department heads’ performance contracts with the City Manager.





Strategic Plan/Hampton Community Plan



The Code of Virginia requires that all local governments in the State prepare and adopt a

comprehensive plan. On March 11, 1987, City Council approved its first Strategic Plan which

was designed to focus the community’s attention and resources on a few issues to ensure the

City’s long-range survivability and ultimate vitality. Since that time the Strategic Plan has been

reviewed and updated twice – 1991, and 1997. The Strategic Plan is used as the foundation for

decision-making in the City of Hampton.



In January 2003, the City in conjunction with the Hampton City Schools and numerous

community partners initiated a broad-based process to review and update both the existing

Hampton Strategic Plan (1998) and the 2010 Comprehensive Plan (1989). On February 8, 2006,

City Council adopted the “Hampton Community Plan” which is the mergence of the two plans.

For the first time, the Community Plan integrated the City’s Strategic Plan, Comprehensive Plan

and planning for the Hampton City Schools. The Community Plan strives to create a unified

vision from a diverse population. The Plan integrates the visions of city residents, businesses,

and local officials into a secure strategy for managing changes within the communities. The Plan

helps to define our community priorities and goals, and specific strategies are developed that

affect most facets of community life including neighborhoods, businesses, schools, youth and

families.



The Community Plan serves as a long term guide for making decisions that will steer the

community toward a destination that is consistent with its visions and goals. The City of

Hampton’s vision is “To make Hampton the most livable city in Virginia”. It was determined

that the vision for Hampton had eight key qualities; Customer Delight, Healthy Business

Climate, Healthy Growth & Development of Children and Youth, Healthy Neighborhoods,

Healthy Diverse Community, Healthy Region, and Strong Schools. These qualities were used as

guidelines to create strategic goals. They have been used as an integral part of the annual budget

development process in ensuring that resources are directed to the most critical areas. The

purpose of the periodic reviews and updates is to ensure that the plan addresses ever changing

community circumstances and resources are directed towards those areas. To read more about

the Hampton Community Plan, review it online at: http://hampton.gov/community-plan/.

Organizational Policy Framework



Budget Development



Each year the Budget Development process focuses on meeting Council’s priorities such as

communicating with citizens, addressing local business concerns, attracting new businesses,

improving the appearance of our neighborhoods, addressing youth and family issues, providing

service delivery which delights our customers, providing funds for education, having a defined

tax rate and fee structure, and preparing a fiscally sound balanced budget which is within the

parameters of the financial policies established by City staff and approved by City Council.



Resources are appropriated based on these priorities. The objective for each priority is then

infused into the performance contract that each Assistant City Manager and Department Head

has with the City Manager. These contracts list specific objectives, strategies and deadlines

which must be met in order to realize Council’s priorities. Each Department Head’s performance

review the following year is based upon successful completion of the objectives and strategies.



Once all Department Heads’ performance contracts have been finalized, a work plan is

established for the entire organization. The work plan is a matrix that lists the normal mission of

each department, Council’s priorities, selected elements from the Hampton Community Plan, the

responsible Department Head’s name and the deadline for accomplishment.





Financial Policies



The issue of Fiscal Health established in a previous Strategic Plan is still very important in

budget development and resource allocation. The objective is to remain tax and service

competitive with surrounding communities while presenting a balanced budget in which planned

revenues available equal planned expenditures. In order to retain competitive tax rates, the

Strategic Plan defined four principles to guide the preparation of a fiscally sound budget (see

Compliance with City Financial Policy section in this document).

Budget Process



General Information



The City of Hampton’s operating budget is prepared annually. The City operates on a July 1 to June

30 fiscal year basis. The City Manager’s proposed fiscal year budget which consists of the City and

School’s budgets must be submitted to City Council no later than April 15th of any given year.

Adoption of the City budget must be completed by May 15th to comply with State law regarding the

deadline for approval of the school system’s budget.



Budget Structure



The structure of the City operations is segregated into different funds. Each fund is comprised of one

or more departments with each department being an organizational unit which provides a major

function such as the Fire & Rescue Division or Human Resource Department.



City departments are comprised of one or more services which are responsible for a specific function

of that particular department (i.e. Emergency Medical Services of the Fire & Rescue Division). Each service level’s appropriation is broken into three major expenditure categories: personal services,

operating, and capital expenses.



Expenditure line items are the individual accounts in which budgetary amounts are entered. The

City’s budget is prepared at the account detail level; however the Council approves the budget at the

major expenditure category level for each department and fund.



Budget Process Steps



Each year, City departments are asked to prepare a budget package based on the complement of

services provided by the department. Departments are required to articulate the major services,

products or activities it will provide to the City’s customers. Each service description must include

the approximate cost of service delivery and the number of people resources used to provide the

service as well as the service goals, objectives and/or standards that residents can expect if the

request is fully funded. Additionally, the Department has to address how each service’s goals and

objectives align with the Strategic Plan (Hampton Community Plan). Each Department is required to

list indicators for measuring the success of the service and its goals and objectives. While the

majority of the measurements used by this organization have been output or workload measures,

ideally, performance measurements should be outcome oriented and should address: “efficiency”

(how well are services delivered); “effectiveness” (are planned accomplishments being met); and

“quality” (are customers satisfied with the results). Departments are generally given a minimum of

three weeks to prepare all budgetary requests.



The Director of Finance is responsible for preparing revenue estimates. Revenue estimates are based

on community economic indicators, historical revenue collection, and state provided information on

aid to localities. Often, it is difficult to finalize revenue estimates until late March as a significant portion of local funding is impacted by the General Assembly’s budget deliberations.

14

Budget Process



This year a Central Budget Team was established to assist the City Manager in departmental budget

submission review. This team consisted of the City Attorney, City Manager, and the three Assistant

City Managers, two representatives from the Hampton City School Board, Finance Director, and

Human Resources Director, facilitated by the Budget Director and budget staff. Every fiscal year,

departments, outside agencies and other organizations submit reoccurring and/or new funding

requests; and each year those requests far exceed available local revenues. Thus the Central Budget

Team attempts to reconcile the available revenues to the articulated needs of the City departments,

citizens, outside agencies and Council. This review may include a recommendation to fund services

at the basic level or eliminate total services, to finance high priority local service expansion, and/or to implement federal and state mandates.



The Central Budget Team examines all alternative service level and frequency options in order to

recommend a balanced budget to the City Manager for final consideration. In doing so, the

Committee considers the community impact of reduced/eliminated services, established Council

priorities and financial policies, input from the local School Board, and contemplates the impact of

revenue changes and the capital budget.



The City Manager reviews the results of the Central Budget Team’s work and often makes further

modifications and changes.





Submission of Budget and Public Hearing



The City Charter requires the City Manager to deliver the recommended budget to Council no later

than April 15th. The Charter also stipulates that Council is required to hold at least one public

hearing on the proposed budget. All interested attendees are heard at that time. Notice of the public hearing is published, along with a summary of the proposed budget, ten days prior to the date of the

hearing. Any notices of proposed increases in tax levies are published at the same time.



This presentation format allows staff, City Council, and citizens alike the opportunity to effectively

question proposed expenditures of funds and to identify services, which could potentially be reduced

and /or eliminated to achieve budgetary savings.





Adoption of the Budget



After the public hearing, City Council makes changes to the Manager’s recommended budget as

deemed appropriate by the body. Any changes in tax rates and/or fees are determined at this point.

The budget must be adopted by at least four affirmative votes, on two different readings.



In addition to the public hearings, Hampton City Council provides for public comment at each of the

two readings of the budget. Final approval of the budget must be completed by May 15th in

accordance with State law.

15

Budget Related Legal Requirements



In accordance with Section 6.09 of the City Charter, the City Manager is required to prepare and

submit a recommended budget to Council on or before April 15th of each year. That section also

sets forth the form of the budget, including what the budget document should show and what should

accompany the actual document. The recommended budget must be in such form that it may

become the official budget of the City. This is important since, according to Section 6.11 of the

City Charter, the City Manager’s recommended budget would become the official City budget if the

City Council did not take final action on the budget prior to June 2nd of any given year.



Section 22.1-93 of the Code of Virginia provides that “notwithstanding any other provision of law...

the governing body of a municipality shall prepare and approve an annual budget for educational

purposes by May 15th or within thirty days of the receipt by said municipality of the estimate of

State funds, whichever shall later occur.”



Action on the budget by City Council can take place only after a public hearing has been held. That

public hearing must have been advertised at least ten days in advance (see City Charter, Section

6.10 online at http://www.municode.com/resources/gateway.asp?pid=10884&sid=46).



The language of Section 22.1-93 of the Code and Section 6.11 of the City Charter, when read

together as a practical matter, requires the City to adopt its budget by May 15th. The final form of

the budget must be approved with at least four affirmative votes of Council Members.



According to the City Charter, the annual appropriation ordinances must be adopted before the

annual tax levy is made (Charter, Section 6.11).



Before the Council can increase any local tax levy, a public hearing must be held on such proposed

local tax increase(s). Notice of public hearings for these purposes must be published in the local

newspaper at least seven days prior to the public hearing at which the public could voice any

concerns. After holding the required public hearing, City Council may increase any local

discretionary tax (see Virginia State Code, Section 58.1-3007).



Section 58.1-3321 of the Code of Virginia requires City Council to reduce the upcoming fiscal

year’s real estate tax levy to 1% or less of the current year’s levy unless Council publishes required

notices in the newspaper at least seven days prior to a public hearing on the matter. During the

FY08, Senate Bill 1063 Assessment rates; notification for rate increase amends Virginia State Code

§58.1-3321. The minimum notice requirement increases from seven days to thirty days in which a

locality must notify the public of a public hearing for any propose increases to the total real estate

tax levies more than 101% of the prior years tax levies, and requires that such notice be posted in

the building where the governing body of the locality ordinarily meets, as well as in a newspaper.



The Virginia Code Section 22.1-94 provides that the City Council may adopt in its appropriation

ordinance the School Board’s budget relating to its “total only or to such major classification

prescribed by the Board of Education pursuant to Virginia Code Section 22.1-115. The Council may

not adopt the School Board’s budget by adding, amending, or deleting specific line items in its

budget. In this instance, the City Council approves the School Board’s budget in total only.



16

Budget Policies and Practices





Budget Basis of Accounting



The City of Hampton’s budget becomes a component of the financial accounting system on July

1 of any given fiscal year. The budgets of general government type funds (i.e., General Fund,

Special Revenue Funds, Debt Service Fund, Capital Projects Fund, School Fund, etc.) are

prepared on a modified accrual basis of accounting.



Under the modified accrual basis, revenues are recognized when they become both measurable

and available to finance operations of the current year. Revenues considered prone to accrual

consist primarily of property taxes, certain grants and sales and utility taxes. Accordingly, real

and personal property taxes are recorded as revenue when levied and billed, net of allowances

for uncollectible amounts. Property taxes not collected within 45 days after year-end are

reflected as deferred revenue. Revenues from federal, state and other grants, the purpose of

which is to fund specific City expenditures, are recorded at time of receipt of notification of the

grant. For financial statement purposes, such amounts are reduced by the unexpended

authorizations, resulting in revenues being recognized only at the time of the related

expenditures. Revenues from general-purpose grants are recognized in the period to which the

grant applies. The sales and utility taxes are collected by the State or the utility company,

generally in the month preceding receipt by the City. License, permits, fines and rents are

recorded as revenue when received.



Expenditures, other than interest and principal on long-term debt, are recorded when the liability

is incurred. Interest and principal on long-term debt are recognized when due.



The accrual basis of accounting is followed in the Internal Services Funds and Enterprise Funds.

Under this method of accounting, revenues are recognized when earned and expenses are

recognized when the related liability is incurred.





Financial Accounting



The Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) shows the status of the City’s finances on

the basis of “generally accepted accounting principles” (GAAP). The General Fund and School

Operating Funds are legally adopted on a basis consistent with GAAP. (For a description of the

procedures for establishing the budgetary data reflected in the financial statements for the

General Fund and School Operating Fund, see the section “Budget Process. An annual budget is not adopted for the Debt Service Fund because effective control is alternatively achieved

through general obligation indenture provisions.



17

Budget Policies and Practices





Budgetary Levels/Controls



The annual appropriation ordinance sets the authorized expenditure level for each department.

The Department heads are given total responsibility and accountability for staying within their

Council approved appropriation level. In Non-General Funds the expenditures cannot exceed the

funding level in that particular fund. During the fiscal year, the budget is constantly monitored

by department heads, the Budget Office and the Finance Department to ensure that no

appropriation is overspent and that all estimated revenues are realized. To assist department

heads in monitoring and controlling their budgets, the Budget Office prepares quarterly budget to

actual reports which measures actual expenditures incurred within the quarter to a standard

measurement by quarter. Additionally, actual expenditures for the period are measured against

like expenditures for the prior two years.



Revenues are measured accordingly. In December, the Finance Director prepares revenue

estimates for the upcoming year and prepares an extensive analysis of the current year’s revenue

situation. At that point, actions to curtail expenditures may be explored. If revenues have

lagged behind estimates and the Budget Office had to initiate cutback measures. These measures

included a hiring freeze, relinquishing five percent of departmental appropriations, scrutiny of all

purchase requisitions and deferral of capital projects financed with operating funds.





Budget Amendments/Transfers Process



During the fiscal year, adjustments to the adopted budget ordinance may become necessary in

order to carry out planned programs, new Council initiative and unexpected expenditures. There

are two types of changes that can occur; budget amendments and budget transfers.



A budget amendment is used to request a transfer of appropriations between departments within

the General Fund and to increase or decrease a department’s and/or fund’s revenue and

expenditure appropriations. An Appropriation Transfer/Journal Voucher form must be

completed which should describe the purpose of the amendment, the justification for the increase

or decrease, the revenue and/or expenditure accounts involved, the amount of the change, signed

by the department’s authorized personnel and the signature of the Budget Director.



A budget transfer is used to request transfers between line-item appropriations within a particular

department or fund without changing the departments/fund appropriation total. The same

Appropriation Transfer/Journal Voucher form is used; only those transfers to or from the

personal category require the signature of the Budget Director authorization.



Budget amendments or any revisions that alter the total appropriation (revenues or expenditures)

of a department or fund must be approved by City Council by resolution. In addition, any budget

transfers are reviewed by Council on a quarterly basis.

18

Budget Policies and Practices





Budget Savings/ Reserves



Annually, at fiscal year-end unencumbered appropriations lapses and encumbered amounts are

carried forward. Encumbrance accounting, under which purchase orders, contracts and other

commitments for the expenditure of monies are recorded in order to reserve that portion of the

applicable appropriation, is employed as an extension of formal budgetary integration in the

General Fund. Encumbrances outstanding at year-end are reported as reservations of fund

balances since they do not constitute expenditures or liabilities. The general fund operating

departments that have not over spent their total budget by year-end will receive 65% of their

total budget savings through an appropriation transfer in the following fiscal year. The remaining

25% goes to general fund balance reserves and 10% is appropriated to the City’s Innovation Pool

for city-wide technological improvements.



Fund balance designations are established to indicate tentative plans for financial resource

utilization in future periods. Designation of fund balance under the General fund represents

amounts appropriated by City Council for the succeeding fiscal year. General Fund undesignated

fund balance which is complied at each fiscal year-end by the Finance Department, represents

excess funds. During the CAFR process, an analysis of these fund balance reserves is completed

to ensure financial policy compliance pertaining to the maintenance of an undesignated fund

balance of not less than 10.0% of estimated revenues is applied (see the “Compliance with City

Financial Policy” section of this document).





19

Description of Budgeted Funds





Governmental-Type Funds



The City of Hampton maintains twelve individual governmental-type funds; all of which

are considered to be major funds of the City’s appropriated budget. The General Fund,

Capital Projects Fund, Debt Service Fund, and the Economic Development Fund are all

considered major governmental funds. There are seven non-major governmental funds

however, only three are appropriated and presented in this budget: Community

Development Block Grant (CDBG), EXCEL Fund, and Stormwater Management. The

modified accrual basis is used to budget all governmental type funds.



General Fund



The General Fund accounts for all revenues and expenditures of the City which are not

accounted for in the other funds. Revenues are primarily derived from general property

taxes, other local taxes, other governmental units and recovered costs. The General Fund

finances most of the regular day-to-day operations of the City. A significant part of the

General Fund’s revenue is transferred to other funds, principally to fund the operations of

the City of Hampton Public Schools and debt service requirements. Other expenditures

include those for general government, public safety, public works, parks, recreation,

human services, etc.



Capital Budget



With the exception of Enterprise and Internal Service Funds, the Capital Budget accounts

for proposed expenditures for capital equipment, education, street/infrastructure,

buildings, community enhancements, economic development, etc. with their financing

sources and should be based on the first fiscal year of the Five-Year Capital Improvement

Plan (CIP). In order to be eligible for the Capital Budget, expenditures must meet the

criteria above, cost over $50,000, and have a life expectancy of five or more years.



Debt Service Fund



This fund accounts for the accumulation of resources for and the payment of, general

long-term debt principal and interest of the City. Primary resources of the Debt Service

Fund are derived from transfers from the General Fund and the proceeds of any refunding

bonds.



Special Revenue Funds



Revenues in this fund are restricted for a specific purpose. The following are the

descriptions of the City’s special revenue funds. For presentation purposes, the

Stormwater Fund is reported under the “Public Works Funds” section of this document.



20

Description of Budgeted Funds





 Community Development Block Grant Fund (CDBG) – These funds, awarded to the

City annually from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, are used to

complement other resources in the implementation of the Healthy Neighborhoods

Initiative.



 Economic Development Fund – This is a capital fund derived primarily from land

sales and rents, established for public improvement projects or purchases and

acquisition of land in support of Economic Development efforts.



 EXCEL Fund - Acronym for Environmental Excellence for Community Enjoyment

and Livability, this fund finances capital improvements which result in improved

social, recreational and cultural opportunities for residents, and beautification of

areas or projects to enhance or preserve something of community value.



 Stormwater Management Fund – This is a special revenue fund that pays for

maintaining the storm drainage system and the quality of our surface waters.

Revenue for this fund comes primarily from stormwater user fees.





Proprietary-Type Funds



The City maintains two types of propriety funds; Internal Service and Enterprise Funds.

These funds are budgeted using the full accrual basis for budgeting.



Internal Service Funds



These proprietary funds are used to account for the financing of goods or services

provided by one department or agency to other departments or agencies of the City, on a

cost reimbursement basis. These departments are accounted for on a similar basis as a

private business. The following are the three Internal Service Fund departments within

the City.



 Fleet Management Fund accounts for the operations of the City’s central

automotive maintenance service facility.



 Information Technology Fund accounts for the costs of providing the following

services: personal computer support, printing, mailing and telecommunications

services.



 Risk Management Fund accounts for the costs of providing insurance coverage

and certain self-insured liabilities of the City and the School Board.





21

Description of Budgeted Funds





Enterprise Funds



Enterprise Funds are used to account for operations that are financed and operated in a

manner similar to private businesses where the intent of the governing body is that the

cost of operating and providing services to the general public are completely or partially

financed from user fees charged to the general public. The Hampton Roads Convention

Center, The Hamptons Golf Course, and the Wastewater Management Fund are

considered major Enterprise Funds. The non-major funds are the Coliseum, Woodland

Road Golf Course, Solid Waste Fund, and the Steam Plant. For presentation purposes, the

Solid Waste, Steam Plant, and the Wastewater funds are presented under the “Public

Works Funds” section of this document.



 Coliseum Fund – accounts for revenues generated and expenses associated with

shows, meetings, civic/community events and other activities provided by the

Coliseum.



 The Hamptons Golf Course Fund – accounts for the operations of three 9-hole golf

courses, snack bar, pro shop and miscellaneous rental revenues.



 Hampton Roads Convention Center Fund – accounts for the revenues and expenses

associated with the activities conducted at the Convention Center.



 Steam Plant Fund – accounts for the operation of the City’s steam generating plant.

Revenues are derived from solid waste disposal fees (tipping fees) charged to the

Solid Waste Fund, the sale of steam to the United States Government, and user fees

charged to external customers.



 Solid Waste Management Fund – This special fund pays for such services as refuse

collection and recycling. Revenue for this fund is derived from commercial tipping

fees and residential user fees.



 Wastewater Management Fund – This Enterprise Fund, created in FY00, earmarks

sewer revenues for sewer line upgrades. Revenue for this fund comes from the

sewer user fee and new connections fees.



 The Woodlands Golf Course Fund – accounts for the operations of an 18-hole golf

course, snack bar, pro shop and miscellaneous rental revenues.





22

Description of Budgeted Funds





Component Units



The Hampton City School Board is a component unit of the City. The general fund

receives State aid from the Commonwealth of Virginia for the schools which is then

transferred to the School Operating Fund. Based on a funding formula the City’s budget

includes a local match that is also transferred to the School Operating Fund.



 School Operating Fund - This special revenue fund is used to account for the

revenues and expenditures of the Hampton City School System.





Interfund Transfers



Interfund transfers (appropriations) involve the budgeting of money from one fund to

another in order to support the functions to be carried out by the receiving fund. General

Fund transfers to other funds may be made for operating as well as capital purposes.



Fiduciary Funds



The City’s budgeted fiduciary obligations/activities are reported within the Retirement

and Benefits section of this budget document. The City excludes these activities from the

City’s government-wide statements because the City cannot use these assets to finance its

operations. The City is the trustee, or fiduciary for its employees’ pension plan: Hampton

Employees Retirement System (HERS) and the Virginia Supplemental Retirement

System (VRS).

Mayor Kearney and Council Members:



I am pleased to present the Manager’s Recommended Budget for Fiscal Year 2009

totaling $443,373,992 which is a 1.77% increase over the FY2008 Approved Budget. Of

this total, the City portion of the budget is $227,493,750 or 1.29% less than the FY 2008

Approved Budget. The Schools portion of this budget is $215,880,242 or a 5.22%

increase over FY2008.



This budget both protects existing city services and funds many critical enhancements

that will make a difference in the community while simultaneously reducing the real

estate tax rate 2 cents. This recommended tax rate reduction would bring our real estate

tax rate to $1.04 per $100 of assessed value. This 2 cent tax rate reduction is significant

in many ways.



Real estate assessments have slowed considerably in the last year, not only in Hampton

but also statewide, thereby making it much more difficult to lower the tax rate. While

this is the fifth straight year that staff has proposed a real estate tax decrease, prior

years’ efforts were less difficult to accomplish because of the large reassessment growth.



Moreover, due to the State budget difficulties, we faced a real loss in State revenues.

The final adopted budget by the General Assembly passed close to $1.1 million of real

cuts to the State revenues received locally. This was on top of the approximately

$800,000 in cuts the Governor imposed mid-year on State revenues, including local law

enforcement funding (known as HB599) and ABC profits among others. Altogether, we

had to absorb nearly $2 million in State revenue losses.



Thus, with little reassessment growth – only 2% for residential properties – and a net

loss in State revenues, we had to look for internal savings to be able to both lower the

tax rate and maintain core service delivery. Nonetheless, because of a slowing

economy, we pushed to do just that so we could continue to provide our residents with





29

tax relief. The 2 cent reduction basically offsets the impact of the average 2 percent

reassessment growth in residential properties.



This is particularly noteworthy since the Council adopted financial guideline on real

estate tax growth would not have required such a reduction. That policy stipulates that

real estate tax revenue growth, net of new construction, from one fiscal year to the next

shall be limited to the equivalent percentage increase in an inflationary growth factor as

measured by either the consumer price index for urban dwellers (CPI-U) or resident

income growth (RI); whichever is greater in any given year. The 2% residential

reassessment growth is indeed lower than both of these measures.



The $1.04 per $100 of assessed value rate, if accepted by Council, would make

Hampton’s rate the lowest it has been at anytime since at least the seventies. This rate also

gives the City of Hampton the lowest real estate tax rate of any urban city in the

Hampton Roads region, except for the City of Virginia Beach, a much wealthier

community by many measures.



It is worth noting here that while our funding formula with the School System would

suggest that the School System share in the reduction of real estate revenues due to the

2 cent tax rate reduction, I have exempted them from their share of the reduction. Their

share of a 2 cent reduction would have properly been $982,496. However, because of

the Council’s and community’s strong commitment to public education, I opted to find

the funds to absorb this impact to the Schools internally on the City side of the budget.

The result is that, if accepted, this budget will fund the Schools by nearly $1 million

more than required by our local funding formula.



Service enhancements included in this budget include the mid-year opening and

operational costs associated with the Teen Center, a new aquatics facility and the

Buckroe fishing pier. Two additional 911 emergency dispatch operators are also added

as are the full year expenses associated with the Internal Audit and Federal Facilities

support functions. Three positions added to the Public Communications function when

it merged mid-year into the re-titled Community & International Relations Office are

also funded for a full-year. Also included is funding to pay for public use of the Boo

Williams Sportsplex and the Hampton Housing Venture program for the Sussex area.



Noteworthy capital improvement projects include: Factory Point restoration and

breakwaters; Back River and Hampton River dredging; demolition and reconstruction

of the Old Hampton Community Center; school maintenance projects; residential street

resurfacing; New American Theater parking lot; master plan implementation funding in

Phoebus, Downtown and Coliseum Central. I have also earmarked $585,000 in

stormwater funds to support a new drainage policy.



30

City debt service also increased this year due to last year’s borrowing for two new

PreK-8 schools. However, due to the dedication of 3 cents on the real estate tax rate and

a $2 million contribution from the Schools, this impact was fully absorbed without

negatively impacting the budget.



I am pleased that I was able to produce these positive budget recommendations.

However, as was noted earlier, the combined effect of a 2-cent tax reduction, the net loss

of State revenue and the addition of these wonderful programs could not be done

without internal reductions. Most city departments were asked to contribute to this

need by slightly reducing their operating budgets. As a result, there will be 16

permanent full-time positions eliminated to help balance the budget. Operating funds

in many departments have been decreased. Several capital improvement projects have

been eliminated or delayed. Fund balance has been used to offset some of the capital

items that remain intact. The amount of available contingency has been reduced. We

have also reduced funding to outside agencies as part of a transitional plan to only fund

those agencies with clear governmental connections (i.e. those who provide services

that we as government would otherwise have to provide and/or which would increase

our caseloads if they ceased to operate).



Regrettably, we also had to reduce the amount of funds for employee compensation.

Our traditional compensation approach has been to provide for merit increase of 2-5%

for our employees, with an average of about 4%. This year, with the tight funding

situation, we have had to scale that back to a merit program which will only support

increases of 2-4%, with an average of about 3%. We have also included funds to

proportionately share in the 6% health insurance premium increases.



Together, these internal reductions and lower than usual employee compensation

dollars, enabled us to balance this budget.



Finally, this budget does contain one user fee increase. The sewer user fee will be

increased from $1.07 per 100 cubic feet to $1.48 per 100 cubic feet. This increase is

required to fund the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) regional consent

order obligation and to enhance sewer rehabilitation efforts. All regional localities are

under the same obligations and thus we expect other cities to also raise this fee in their

communities.



In summary, I just want to say that I am very proud of the staff and Council work that

went into this budget process. A budget document represents the culmination of many

hours of effort of many people. While this budget will not please everyone because of

minor reductions in city department funds, delay in some capital projects, the reduction

in outside agency funding and lower employee compensation dollars, I am nonetheless

convinced it is the best budget staff could put forward. This is a balanced and fiscally



31

responsible budget that accomplishes all of Council’s most immediate interests and

goals. It invests in the protection and continued enhancement of our city’s families,

neighborhoods, business sector and quality of life AND simultaneously reduces the real

estate tax rate for the fifth straight year.



I look forward to working with you during this budget deliberation phase. My staff

and I are ready to assist you with any questions or concerns you may have regarding

this budget recommendation.



Respectfully submitted,





Jesse T. Wallace, Jr.

City Manager





32

Internal Measures Taken to Balance Budget

Although this budget has received minimal growth in revenues, City staff continues to

look at opportunities within the City to fund higher priority programs and stay within the

imposed expenditure policies set by Council. This is accomplished through program

reductions/eliminations, identifying program savings and the use of fund balance for one-

time expenditures. The following identifies those internal measures taken to balance the

FY09 Budget.

Long-Term Strategic and Financial Planning



Strategic Objectives:



The Community Plan is based on visions and goals that define the City’s desired future.

Hampton’s vision is “To make Hampton the most livable city in Virginia.” It was determined

that the vision for Hampton had eight key qualities:



1. Customer Delight



2. Healthy Business Climate

3. Healthy Growth & Development of Children and Youth

4. Healthy Neighborhoods

5. Healthy Diverse Community

6. Healthy Region

7. Strong Schools

8. Youth



The following are long-term initiatives that have been funded in the FY09 Budget that serves as

a basis for one or more key qualities:



 Capital and operating funding to further implement the Master Plans in accordance with

the Comprehensive Plan.

 Funding for a Director of Federal Facilities Support responsible for leading and directing

Hampton’s efforts to partner and build relationships with NASA, Langley Air Force Base

and other federal organizations. To foster the continued operation, long-term prosperity

and growth of Hampton-based operations consistent with the City’s vision and values.

 Establishment of a new Community and International Relations Department to foster

collaborations between the City of Hampton government and the education community in

order to enhance the profile and strengthen our community outreach efforts; and to

provide a comprehensive media communications regarding key issues, initiatives,

recognition, and/or opportunities that impact citizens.

 Continue to provide customers service through our 311 Call Center and immediate

responses from our Emergency 911 dispatch center.

 Ensure adequate staffing and competitive compensation for all employees.

 Continue the revitalization and economic development for blighted properties.

 Continue the redevelopment projects within neighborhoods through the Community

Block Grant.

 Establish the initial funding for a new drainage program to address the lack of curb and

gutters in older neighborhoods that have some impact on the speed and efficiency on

City-wide drainage issues.

 Communities throughout the country, including Hampton Roads Region are addressing

the issue of necessary upgrades to aging sanitary sewer systems. A Regional Content

Order ratified by the State Water Control Board, require a five-year study period to

identify the causes of overflows and to develop a plan to correct those problems. The

36

Long-Term Strategic and Financial Planning



FY09 budget provides for a 41-cent increase in sewer user fees from $1.07 to $1.48 in

order to meet the commitments made under this Consent Order.

 Provide for leisure and recreational activities for our youth with the opening of the Teen

and Aquatic Center in early 2009 and providing access for all citizens to the Boo

Williams Sportsplex indoor track.

 Continues to fund the construction of two new Hampton City Schools.





Financial Objectives:



 Continuously refine the Five-Year Revenue and Expenditure Forecast in December of

every fiscal year for long-term planning purposes.

 Continue to plan the Five-Year Capital Improvement Plan to ensure adequate financing.

 Consistently increase the local contribution to the Hampton City Schools in excess of

State Required Match.

Financial Policies



The City Council adopted a set of financial parameters to guide future City expenditure

patterns. These financial policies and their compliance with the approved budget are

outlined in this section.



City Tax Revenue Guideline



City Council approved a guideline for budget development in which real estate tax revenue

growth (net of new construction) from one fiscal year to the next shall be limited to the

equivalent percentage increase of an inflationary growth factor as measured by either the

consumer price index for urban dwellers (CPI-U) or resident income growth (RI);

whichever is greater in any given year. To the extent that budgetary needs require real

estate revenues to grow faster than this factor, the Manager and Council shall explicitly

explain the budget driving factors causing this so that residents may have a concise and

clear understanding of the need to deviate from this financial guideline.



For FY 2009, the real estate assessment growth is expected to average 3%. This growth is

below the guidelines established by City Council and therefore, the guideline stated above

was not applied to the Fiscal Year 2009 Budget.



City Financial Policy



In April 2007, the City Council amended its existing financial policies. The financial

policies relate to general operating elements of the City. These polices are used as financial

planning parameters during the annual budget process. The five (5) financial polices and

the actual results are summarized below. The City’s FY09 Manager’s Recommended

Budget is in compliance with all five policies.





1.

Debt Policy Limit (Schedule A). This policy is comprised of three guidelines as

outline below:

(a) General obligation debt shall not exceed 3% of the assessed value of all

real estate within the City subject to taxation. The legal debt limit authorized

by the Virginia State Statute limits bond issuing authority up to 10% of the

assessed value. The FY09 estimated general obligation debt will total $295.4

million or 2.6% of taxable real estate value, which is within the policy

parameter.



(b) General obligation bonded debt together with indirect debt, which includes

certain revenue backed debt and subject-to-appropriation or moral obligation

commitments, and debt of certain special purpose entities (i.e. Community

Development Authority) shall not exceed 4.5% of the estimated FY09

assessed value of all real and personal property subject to taxation within the

City. This would amount to $514 million or 4.1% of the assessed value of all

taxable real and personal property which is within the policy parameter.

38



Financial Policies (continued)



(c) Debt of certain special purpose entities, such as community development

authorities, shall not exceed 1% of the assessed value of all real and personal

property subject to taxation within the City. The expected amount is $102.3

million or 0.08% of the approximate FY09 assessed value of all taxable real

and personal property, which is within the policy parameter.



2.

Debt Service Policy Limit (Schedule B). General obligation bonded debt and

indirect debt shall not exceed 10% or $45.3 million of the City’s total General

Fund and the School Operating Fund expenditures. This amount totals $35

million or 7.8% of total expenditures, which is within the policy parameter.



3.

General Obligation Debt Retirement Policy (Schedule C). The City shall retire

60% of the principal balance of general bonded obligation debt within 10 years of

the date the debt is issued. The City will retire approximately $184.5 million or

63% of general bonded obligation debt in FY2018, which is within 10 years of

the issue date of the General Obligation Public Improvement and Refunding

Bonds, Series 2007.



4.

Equity Funding (Schedule D). A minimum of 2% to 6% of general fund

revenues will be applied to Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) projects each year.

For FY09, capital expenditures are estimated to be $9.7 million which is 3.7% of

General Fund revenues. Also, a minimum of 10% to 15% of CIP projects over a

rolling five-year period are to be funded from general fund revenues. For the 5

year period, FY09 through FY13, the City plans to use an estimated $52.2 million

or 20% of General Fund revenues on CIP projects.



5.

Undesignated Fund Balance (Schedule E). The City will maintain an

undesignated General Fund balance equal to 10% of total General Fund and

School Operating Fund revenues less School transfers. For FY09, those estimated

revenues are expected to total $441.4 million. The undesignated fund balance at

June 30, 2008 is forecasted to be $44.1 million or 10% which is in compliance

with this policy. To the extent undesignated fund balance falls below the policy,

the shortfall shall be replenished over a three-year period.



The City is in compliance with the Financial Policy Guidelines.

Credit Ratings

The City’s credit ratings are as follows: AA by Standard and Poor’s, Aa2 by Moody’s

Investor Services and AA by Fitch Rating.

39

Composition of Amounts Used to Calculate Compliance with

City’s Financial Policies





1.

Annual Budget ~ represents the total General Fund estimated revenues and

appropriations approved by City Council in the annual appropriation ordinance.



2.

Assessed Value ~ this refers to the assessed value of all taxable real estate within the

geographic boundaries of the City as of the most recent annual appraisal by the City

Assessor’s Office, except amount labeled estimates. This amount is based on the City

Assessor’s estimate prior to actual appraisal.



3.

Capital Expenditures ~ represent the amounts appropriated in the General Fund to

fund major Capital Improvements and Economic Development projects.



4.

CIP ~ Capital Improvement Plan is a five-year plan outlining the funding for major

purchases, acquisition and/or construction of capital assets.



5.

Debt Service ~ the City’s payment of principal and interest related to all long-term

debt according to a pre-determined payment schedule.



6.

Local Revenues ~ equal all General Fund revenues, except State revenue and Federal

aid.



7.

Overlapping Debt ~ there are no overlapping debt or underlying tax jurisdictions.



8.

Net Bonded Debt ~ this amount represents the unmatured, unpaid and outstanding

General Obligation Bonds of the City as of June 30 of each year shown.



9.

Total Estimated Revenues ~ represent the total General Fund estimated revenues,

less State and Federal revenues received exclusively for public school operations.



10.

Undesignated Fund Balance ~ is the General Fund balance net of reserves and other

restricted (special purpose) amounts (sometimes referred to a fund balance available

for appropriation).

* This balance is net of $4.0 million designated for the FY09 Capital Budget.

Note: The City's financial advisor, Davenport & Company LLC, indicates that AA-rated jurisdictions in Virginia on average maintain an undesignated fund balance ranging between 7.5% to 8.0% of general fund revenues, but they are recommending that we increase our policy to 10.0% of general fund revenues. During the 2007 fiscal year, Council approved the increase the policy guideline from 7.5% to 10%. The rating agencies consider an adequate fund balance to be an indicator of a strong financial position and prudent financial management.

The overall projected increase in General Fund revenues before school funding and transfers is

2.12% or $6,051,037. These estimates are based on historical trends, current market condition, and

for one-half year of operating the Teen Center, as

well as funding for youth basketball leagues' use

of the Boo Williams Sportsplex.

annualization of salary increases granted by the

State in FY08 for the Clerk of Court and Sheriff

employees.

Economic Vitality

(217,606)

The net decrease in this business team is the result



of a reduction for attrition and the elimination of

five PFT positions in Economic Development and

Convention and Visitor Bureau. This budget adds

one

commercial

appraiser

position

to

the

Assessor's Office.

Infrastructure

(382,429)



The net decrease in the Infrastructure team

represents reductions for attrition and fixed costs

as well as reductions due to budgetary restraints in

Public Works and Parks. Funded in this business

team is one-half year operation of the Buckroe

Fishing Pier, utility costs for the Teen Center and

maintenance funds for capital projects software.

Neighborhood and Housing

(56,201)

retirements.

(Decrease)

Explanation

Public Safety

(813,846)

The majority of the decrease in this business team



is the result of attrition, a reduction in overtime

costs in Fire Department, elimination of three PFT

positions in Animal Control which has been taken

over by the Police Department, deferral in filling

five vacant police officer positions approved in

FY08 Budget and reduction of WAE salaries. This

budget also funds two PFT emergency dispatcher

positions due to increased volume of EMS calls.

Quality Government

430,369

The net increase in Quality Government funds the

creation of the Internal Auditor department, the

merger

of

Public

Communications into the

Community

and

International

Explanation

Contributions to Outside

606,189



The net increase is the result of increases pertaining

Agencies

to the Regional Jail, Hampton Roads Transit, a

required increase to the SPCA, funding for the

Hampton Housing Venture program - Sussex

neighborhood, contractual commitment to the Boo

Williams Sportsplex for public use and the

Peninsula Stadium Authority.

Some of these

increases have been offset by a change in policy

regarding the funding of outside agencies (see Tab

17 for more information)

Debt Service

4,733,269

Debt Service increases to pay debt on the bond

issue that funds new redevelopment and school

projects. This increase is funded with funds set

aside last year by Council in anticipation of this

increase (3-cents dedicated real estate tax rate and

a $2 million contribution from the Schools).

Transfer to Capital Budget

(1,020,147)

The decrease reflects the reduction or elimination

of some capital projects in order to balance this

budget.

Transfer to Other Funds

(9,231,221)

The reduction in this category reflects the transfer

of funds previously sent to the Debt Service reserve

fund that are now reflected in the Debt Service

category above. Also this decrease reflects the

reduction of one-time fund balance used in FY08 to

start the debt reserve account. The funds allocated

for scientific research/high technology development

in the form of a transfer to the IDA, are reduced

since FY08 funds have yet to be spent. These

funds will be re-appropriated should the project

proceed.

School Operations

2,699,095

The increase in the local contribution to schools is

Local Funds

the result of an agreed upon formula in which the

schools will receive a pre-defined percentage of

residential general property taxes and utility taxes.

Further, the local contribution to Schools is based

on a $1.06 real estate tax rate as opposed to the

actual final rate of $1.04.

School Operations - State

8,001,361



This increase reflects the

Schools revenues

and Federal Funds

received from State, Federal and other sources.

Purpose of Department Business Teams



The City Council conducted a visioning retreat in the fall of 2006. As part of this retreat,

the Council outlined eight areas of focus critical to the City’s success. Those areas were:



• Art, Culture and Recreation

• Economic Vitality

• Education

• Infrastructure

• Neighborhoods and Housing

• Public Safety

• Quality Government

• Youth and Families



Council members outlined their expectations – both short and long term – for investment

and progress in these areas.



To help better connect the work of the organization to the Council vision, the City

Manager organized business teams around each of these critical areas of focus. Similarly,

the Manager and staff made a commitment to present the budget according to key

business team areas. City departmental budgets are presented in the business area for

which they have the most direct link. It is important to note, however, that many

departments contribute to more than one business area.



Business teams focus the City’s organization on the initiatives selected by their elected

and appointed leaders. Business teams are facilitated by the City Manager and his

assistants to achieve an interconnectedness that is critical in today’s operating

environment. Business team management enhances financial control and long-range

planning by requiring that all departments focus not only on their individual needs but

also on the needs of the business unit as well. Business teams are expected to develop

annual and long-range goals; integrate departmental plans to key business unit plans;

share resources across departmental lines as necessary; eliminate disparity in the

application of organizational policies; and, most of all, make a positive and substantial

contribution to the attainment of the City’s mission statement – to be the most livable city

in Virginia.



Increasing demands for services with dwindling revenues from the federal and state

governments compels us to tighten financial and operational control in the organization.

The clustering of departments into key business units accomplishes that. More

importantly, however, business team management will allow us to be better prepared for

future challenges such as homeland security; human self-sufficiency development; and

redevelopment. No one department acting in isolation can prepare our citizens or

community for these challenges – it takes a strongly coordinated and integrated effort on

the part of multiple departments and outside entities to achieve what our community will

need in the future.

The goal of the court is to promote a positive image of the court and court services by meeting the "Case Processing Guidelines for General District Courts" adopted by the Virginia Judicial Council on July 1, 1995

which states:

• 95% of all Civil uncontested cases should be disposed of within 60 days of filing; 100% should be

disposed of within 120 days.

• 90% of all Civil contested cases should be disposed of within 90 days of filing; 100% should be

disposed of within 180 days.

• 90% of all Traffic infractions and misdemeanors should be adjudicated or otherwise disposed of

within 60 days; 100% within 90 days.

• 90% of Criminal misdemeanors should be adjudicated or otherwise disposed of within 60 days from

day of arrest; 100% within 90 days.

• Preliminary hearings on felonies should be held within 45 days of the date of arrest.

Complying with the policy adopted by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Virginia that “no litigant should have to wait more than one hour for their case to be called on the day of the hearing”. The General District Court, in an effort to comply with this policy, established a segmented docket schedule. Specific types of cases are set on certain dockets to be heard at different times during each day. The court limits the number of cases that are set for trial on the criminal and civil dockets and monitors the number of cases set on the traffic dockets to better meet with this policy. To continue to provide excellent customer service to the citizens of Hampton and the Commonwealth of Virginia.

Magistrates supplements. The increase in operating expenses is the result of an increase in fixed

costs. Otherwise, this is a maintenance level budget.

during FY08 and the elimination of three (3) permanent full-time positions as a result of budget

reductions. A Police Corporal and Captain now supervise operations. The net increase in operating

is due to an increase in fixed costs.

HUMAN SERVICES ~ COMPREHENSIVE SERVICES ACT

The Comprehensive Services Act for At-Risk Youth and Families requires that locally

coordinated services be provided to families whose children are at high risk of out-of-home

placement. The approach allows agencies to focus their combined efforts on the total needs of

families instead of being driven by the agencies' different administrative structures and

regulations. This budget covers the local required match for service delivery to families whose

children are at risk of out-of-home placement.

The total budget for the department is $1,874,095, which funds the following services in these

approximate amounts:

Outside Agency Funding Policy



During the FY 2008 budget development process, the City Council indicated that they wanted to

review and consider possible changes to the outside agency funding process sometime during the fall.

Accordingly, staff made presentations to City Council on October 24, 2007 and November 7, 2007.

These presentations included a review of the current process, its strengths and weaknesses and

possible alternative processes by which the funding for these groups could be evaluated.



The reasons for considering alternatives processes were outlined as follows:

• Limited dollars and increasing requests from current and new organizations

• Unlimited numbers of potentially worthy programs in the community

• Importance of evaluating the return on the City’s investment to do the most for the

community



The alternative processes suggested included:

• Alternative #1: Council creates a Citizens Committee to reviews & forward recommendations

to Council for final decision-making

• Alternative #2: Council gives a set amount of funds to a Citizens Commission which makes

distributions directly to agencies

• Alternative #3: Independent Agency handles for Council (ex. United Way)

• Alternative #4: Eliminate community support outside agency funding unless it is done in

conjunction with a city department budget request (i.e. the city department makes the case

that the non-profit is providing the service as an extension of the department’s services)



After much Council deliberation, alternative four was supported in concept.



To begin the process of further exploring alternative four, all city departments were asked to evaluate the current list of outside agencies receiving financial support. Each department was asked to

demonstrate how the non-profits directly supported their service delivery, if at all. Direct support of a department was defined as work that if ceased would cause corresponding, or larger, increases in city

government budgets/caseloads.



After this work was done, it was clear that while some current non-profit contributions met this test,

all did not. Because the total elimination of funding, without notice, would cause problems for any

agency, and because all of the agencies are worthwhile organizations, the City Manager opted instead

to develop a transition plan for implementing alternative four.



This transition plans calls for level funding of those agencies with clear governmental connections, as defined above, and for those agencies without a clear governmental link the follow applies: a 25% cut

in FY09; 50% cut in FY10; 75% cut in FY11 and no further funding in FY12. Beginning in FY

2010, those agencies with clear governmental connections will be transferred to the appropriate

department which directly benefits from those services and that department will make a budget case

for annual funding levels for those agencies as part of their individual budget submission. Those

agencies without the strong government connection would cease to receive municipal funding

beginning in FY 2010.

FY09 Agency Relations Support





Center for Child and Family Services - a non-profit agency specializing in the counseling, education and support of child and family issues. The Center for Child and Family Services provided assistance to 297 Hampton families, some of whom are either at or below the poverty level, uninsured, or possess

inadequate insurance coverage, totaling 1,529 service hours for Fiscal Year 2007. The Center provides

affordable behavioral health services to families experiencing a crisis in order to prevent the violence and loss of productivity common in such situations. The Center collaborates with many City agencies and

departments in its programming.



Children’s Hospital of the King’s Daughters (CHKD) Child Abuse Center - provides compassionate

diagnostic assessment (medical and mental) and treatment services to Hampton children and their families through the intervention of various community agencies such as Child Protective Services,

Commonwealth’s Attorney, City Attorney, the courts, and other law enforcement agencies. Forensic

interviews are also offered free of charge to all Hampton Roads investigative agencies and families.

Regional training for multi-disciplinary agencies is also provided.



Downtown Hampton Child Development Center (DHCDC) - provides a quality, developmentally-

appropriate preschool for children ages three to five years whose parents are pursuing self-sufficiency.

Downtown Hampton is the only sliding-scale tuition preschool on the Peninsula and bases its fees on

family need and income. It is the designated Hampton site for the Virginia Pre-School Initiative for At-Risk Four-Year-Olds. Currently 300 children are served. The evaluation results are extremely positive for school readiness in the children served.



Foodbank of the Virginia Peninsula – partners with neighborhood-based community service efforts

to provide emergency food assistance through a variety of programs such as: the Food Distribution

Program that distributes donated items to Hampton residents through a network of 149 community-based

service providers and agencies; the Prepared Foods Program that distributes prepared and perishable food items to a network of community service providers with food safety training; the Nutrition

Education/Self-Sufficiency Program, which individuals or representatives from community service

providers, receive nutrition, life skills, and food training in Hampton; and the Kid Café Program which provides nutritious afternoon meals or snacks to children in after-school programs in a safe, caring, and learning environment.



Hampton Ecumenical and Lodging Provisions (H.E.L.P.) - a cooperative, interfaith community

service organization with 61 member congregations, provides emergency shelter, transitional housing,

primary/preventive health care, food through a community food pantry, weekly bag lunch program, and

financial assistance to the homeless, hungry and those in emergency financial need. H.E.L.P.

congregations pool financial resources, volunteer time, facilities, goods and services in collaboration with existing city and state agencies not only as a preventable measure, but also to empower service recipients with the means to achieve their own self-sufficiency. The Department of Social Services and the

Hampton Police Division frequently call upon H.E.L.P. The largest part of this agency’s budget comes

from churches and community contributions. In Fiscal Year 2007, H.E.L.P assisted 9,841 Hampton

residents.



Insight Enterprises, Inc. - a private, non-profit agency established to provide services and programs to persons with disabilities, thus enabling them to lead independent, productive lives to become full

participants in their communities. This agency has been designated by the State of Virginia as the

provider of independent living skills and receives its primary funding from federal and state sources.

Contributions are also received from localities along with fees from participants. Services to clients include training in independent living skills, employment counseling, and development of independent

living plans.

235





Mayor’s Committee for People with Disabilities - serves as an advocate for the citizens of Hampton with disabilities assuring that they receive the same rights and opportunities as those without disabilities.

The Mayor’s Committee develops, conducts and supports educational programs for the public, employers,

caregivers, and others in the community. They also conduct accessibility surveys of businesses, schools, parking areas, etc. to aid them in meeting ADA requirements, and to monitor all legislation that pertains to the disabled and make recommendations to the appropriate legislative body or representation. The

Mayor’s Committee for People with Disabilities also publishes the People with Disabilities, a quarterly newsletter with articles of interest to the disabled. Interpreters are also provided for City Council meetings if requested.



Office of Human Affairs (OHA) - plans, develops and implements programs that foster self-sufficiency through educational, social, physical and economic development. The agency’s mission focuses on

providing services to low-income residents to improve their quality of life. The programs that directly benefit Hampton residents are Head Start (342 residents); 4-Year-Old Initiative (253 preschool children and their parents); Employment Services; the Peninsula Community Development Corporation and

Housing Counseling (200 residents); and Project Discovery (college planning) for middle and high school students.



Peninsula Agency on Aging, Inc. (PAA) - provides assistance to older Americans (60 years and up) who desire to stay in their own homes and communities with maximum dignity and independence for as long

as possible. In accordance with the Older Americans Act, as amended, priority is given to those persons who are in the greatest economic or social need with particular attention to low-income minority

individuals. A major portion of the agency’s funding is attached to very specific guidelines for targeting resources to specific services such as nutrition, transportation, home care, and care coordination. Local funding is requested to maintain existing service levels, provide flexibility in the provision of gap-filling services, and provide the local match for federal funds along with increase demand for in-home care,

meals on wheels and medical transportation.



Star Achievers Academy (SAA) – established in 1995, is a partnership between the business and educational communities which later became a branch of the Peninsula YMCA in 1998. In 2002, Star

Achievers was a major partner in the transformation and opening of Cooper Elementary Magnet School

clubhouse programming” the Denbigh House provides a high intensity multifaceted vocational

rehabilitation program aimed at increasing levels of independence and productivity. Denbigh House is

the only community-based program in this area.

Debt Management Policies





The City maintains a separate Debt Service Fund that tracks long-term debt obligated for

General Fund activities. Included in the following debt service requirement is general

obligation bonds, school literary loans and debt associated with land acquired using a Letter

of Credit. Debt service for Enterprise, Internal Service and Special Revenue funds are

accounted for in that individual fund’s activity.



Each fiscal year, the City of Hampton supports the acquisition, construction, renovation and

infrastructure maintenance stated in its five-year adopted Capital Improvement Plan. The

capital projects are funded from pay-as-you-go current revenues (general operating revenues),

federal and state revenues, appropriation from fund balance and the issuance of general

obligation bonds. The CIP provides a foundation to plan and structure debt in advance. The

repayment period of the debt should not exceed the expected useful life of the capital project

for which the debt is incurred. In doing so, specific sources are identified and dedicated to the

retirement of debt. On April 11, 2007, the City adopted a financial policy regarding the

minimum amount of general fund revenues that can be used to fund the CIP each year and

over a rolling 5-year period. See the Compliance with City Financial Policy, section of this document.



The adopted Capital Improvement Plan for fiscal year 2009 includes scheduled bond

anticipation notes of $22.1 million in general improvement bonds for both the City and

Schools capital projects. The fiscal year 2008-09 Adopted Budget includes $6,000,000

designated for debt reserves; with $4,000,000 from General Fund Balance and $2,000,000

from the Hampton City School Operating Fund. The debt service requirement for these

obligations has been included in the City’s debt service funding projections on the following

pages.



During FY07, the City adopted revisions to its financial policies relating to the amount of

outstanding debt; the amount of overlapping debt; annual debt service costs and the payout

ratio on general obligations indebtedness. For more details regarding the City’s policies on

debt, refer to the Compliance with City Financial Policies section of this document.



The City’s credit ratings are as follows: AA by Standard and Poor’s, Aa2 by Moody’s

Investor Services and AA by Fitch Rating.

Budget Note: Revenues from the General Fund and Fund Balance will be used to finance Capital

Projects in FY09. The transfer to the Bass Pro Fund accounts for direct revenues generated by the store and sets them aside in an IDA account as part of the agreement between the City and Bass Pro, should

they be needed. The contributions to the EXCEL Fund and The Hamptons Enterprise Fund have

remained constant. The increased contribution to the Convention Center Fund can be attributed to

higher revenue estimates for both the meals and lodging taxes that are apportioned to the Convention

Center Fund and anticipated revenues generated from the project to offset the operating deficit.

The reduction in the Debt Service Reserve Fund is a result of eliminating $4 million dollars in one-time fund balance funds that were used to start the Reserve Fund. Another $4,733,269 was transferred to

Debt Service to fund the School construction debt. The reduction in transfer to the IDA account is a

result of the FY08 funds not having been spent. If the Council and IDA move forward with the projects,

FY08 funds will be reappropriated.

1 Effective July 1, 2007, the General Fund subsidy to the Emergency 911 Fund is no longer required since the revenues from this fund are now collected in the general fund. Therefore, all expenditures and revenues for the E-911 department are now budgeted in the general fund.

Capital Improvement Plan Policies





Purpose



The purpose of the Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) is to provide a structural process for

funding major acquisitions, improvements and new construction projects. Generally, projects

included in the CIP, must have a useful life of at least five years and initial costs in excess of

$50,000. The useful life of an existing asset or newly created assets cannot exceed the life of

the debt instrument used to finance the project.



The FY 2009-2013 Capital Improvement Plan totals $257,013,483. This is a 15.1% decrease

when compared to the FY 2008-2012 CIP total of $302,842,448. For the fiscal year 2009, the

adopted capital budget totals $37,857,267.





City Policy Statement



The financial parameters for pay-as-you go funding the CIP are that no less than two percent

(2%), but no more than six percent (6%) of estimated revenue (less Schools) in the annual

operating budget shall be devoted to capital expenditures. The total estimated General Fund

operating revenues for FY 2009 is $297,210,314. To adhere to this policy, the contributions

from the General Fund (GF) which includes general fund operating revenues transfer from

general fund balance and urban maintenance contributions cannot be less than $5,944,206 and

no more than $17,832,619. For fiscal year 2009, the total amount of funds being transferred

from the general fund to the capital projects fund is $9,668,969 (or 3.8%) which is within the

City financial parameters.



A second tier to the above financial policy was adopted on April 11, 2007 by City Council

and states a minimum of 10% to 15% of the total CIP expenditures over a rolling 5-year

period shall be funded from general fund revenues. The 5-year CIP totals $257,013,483; the

10% to 15% minimum is equal to $25,701,438 and $38,552,022, respectively. For the FY

2009-2013 CIP, the City anticipates funding $51,769,817 (or 20.1%) from General Fund

revenues. This amount is in compliance with the policy parameters.



While current revenues provide funding for some capital projects, other revenues are received

from Federal and State sources such as the CMAQ (Congestion Mitigation Air Quality) funds,

HSIP (Highway Safety Improvement Program) funds, Stormwater funds, UDAG (Urban

Development Action Grant) funds, and Urban Construction Funds. However, over the next

five year period, a large portion of financing will mainly come from the issuance of General

Obligation Bond proceeds. For financial policies regarding the maximum amount of debt that

the City can issue, refer to the Compliance with City Financial Policy section of this document.



It is the long-term goal of the Capital Budget Committee to use pay-as-you-go funding for

annual, recurring maintenance-type projects; use funding from the general fund balance for

one-time only capital expenditures; and limit the amount of public funds designated for new

projects/new construction and Economic Development projects. Bond proceeds are used to

fund major one-time capital projects.

249

Capital Improvement Plan Policies (continued)





CIP Process



Each year, as part of the annual budget process, the City Council updates its five-year forecast

for capital improvements. Based on the requests made by various City departments,

community groups and revenue projections, a Capital Budget Committee makes a

recommendation to the Planning Commission, City Manager and City Council identifying

those capital projects being changed, added, or deleted and new projects that have become a

high priority.



Capital projects include such items as road extensions and intersections, new construction of

public facilities, maintenance of existing facilities, and the acquisition of land for future

public use. The CIP projects are classified into one of eight categories:



 Capital Equipment





 Other CIP Projects

 Community Enhancement

 Public Facilities

 Economic Development

 Public Safety

 Education

 Streets & Infrastructures





The CIP is adopted by City Council at a public hearing by ordinance. The first year of the plan is

adopted as the Capital Budget for the current fiscal year after some modifications by formal

resolution. A separate Capital Improvement Plan document is prepared each year which contains

the expenditures and revenues forecasted for the five-year period.





Operating Budget Impact



Some projects outlined in this plan have a direct impact on the City’s operating budget once the

project is acquired or completed. This impact may require ongoing expenses for staff, other

operating costs and capital outlays. Refer to the schedule in the following capital budget section

regarding those projects and its estimated impact on future operating budgets. Projects funded

through debt financing (typically Council authorized) also impact the operating budget through

ongoing debt service expenses. Refer to the Debt Service section in this document.





For more detailed of the City’s Capital Improvement Plan for FY 2009-FY 2013 see the separate

CIP published report.

Budget Note: This budget assumes a General Fund transfer of $630,000 to avoid net operating

losses before depreciation and to fund the debt service for the facility. As depreciation remains

unfunded, this entity will most likely compete with other capital projects for funding of major

improvements and equipment. The increase in this budget is due to merit and fringe benefits

increases along with a slight increase in fixed costs.

The Arts Commission, a citizen-comprised board established in 1987, continues to strengthen the partnership between the City, the cultural constituency, and the private sector by presenting year-round entertainment and exhibitions. The Commission runs two historic buildings in Hampton: the Charles H. Taylor Arts Center and the restored American Theatre. The 400-seat theatre reopened in June 2000 and has rapidly become a valuable venue for the performing arts in Hampton Roads.

COMPARISON OF TAX RATES OF VIRGINIA’S TEN LARGEST

CITIES



Fiscal Year 2009 Revenue Sources



The following comparison has been created to identify and compare major revenue sources for the

ten most populated cities in Virginia. The sources of revenue used in this comparison are taxes and

fees that are determined and implemented at the local level. To enhance this study, an attempt has

been made to convert various tax rates into hypothetical tax payments, which residents or

commercial businesses would be required to pay.



A brief comparison of these requirements eliminates important elements concerning the cost of

living in one city versus another. The amount of taxes paid to a local government is a factor not

only of demography, the quality of services and the varying costs of services in different areas of

the State, but most importantly, in the number of services provided publicly. Many basic services

such as water and sewage treatment, refuse collection, and street lighting may be administered by

the local government, a separate government district, or in some cases, a private entity. This

analysis, unfortunately, does not take into account these differences across localities. To do so

would require an in-depth study of the practices of each local government, which cannot be

attempted in the following pages.



What this study attempts to do is make a comparison of the basic tax rates charged to citizens and

business organizations. These are the most consistent taxes found throughout Virginia cities as well

as the majority of local revenue collected. The following tax rates contained in this study are for

Fiscal Year 2008. The following is a list of tax rates contained in this report (in the order they

appear):



 Real Property Tax





 Hotel and Motel Lodging Tax

 Personal Property Tax





 Landfill Tipping Fee

 Residential Utility Tax

VA Code §58.1-645, §58.1-1730, §56-468.1. Effective January 2007, authority for existing local taxes/fees on communications are revoked by this act. The new communications taxes are billed and collected by the service providers and paid to the Virginia Department of Taxation (VDT) after deducting a 3% administrative allowance. VDT

then deducts its administrative costs and the cost of the hearing impaired program (2) from the pooled revenues. The balance is then used to pay the Cable TV franchise fees to those localities which have a franchise agreement that was in effect prior to the passage of the act (no new agreements may impose a fee) and would previously receive a payment based on utility gross receipts. The remaining funds are then allocated among localities based on their share of total telecommunications taxes collected statewide in fiscal year 2005-2006. Cell Phone E-911 Tax will continue to accrue to and be disbursed by the Virginia Wireless E-911 Services Board.



In addition to the tax rates contained in this study, comparative statistical information and service

indicators for the Hampton Roads Area have been included. This information can be used as a

reference while evaluating the different tax structures in our area.

Notes: Suffolk has four tax zones, with real estate tax rates ranging from $.94 to $1.34. Per Suffolk staff, the majority of its citizens are levied at the $.94 rate. In FY 1994-95, Suffolk changed its method of appraising personal property from using 50% of retail value to using loan value, which is generally lower than retail value.

The loan value method is used by other Hampton Roads communities.

Chesapeake has a base real estate tax rate of $1.03 and a base personal property tax rate of $4.00. However, the rates are increased by $.02 and $.08, respectively, for 85% of the City's residents who reside in a mosquito district.
