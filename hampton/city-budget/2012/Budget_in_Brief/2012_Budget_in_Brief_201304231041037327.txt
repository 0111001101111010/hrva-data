

Capital Budget 7-8

Required Local Contribution according to State Law is



$26,336,623. The amount of this contribution is affected by Additional Information

the changes in the Commonwealth of Virginia funding to the

and Copies 8

Hampton City Schools. For FY2012, the state reduced the



schools’ stabilization funding by 100% or $2,785,985. The reduction in real estate revenue and other formula driven

revenues reduced the required local funding amount by 1.05%

or $706,383.

 Local Contribution in Excess of State Requirement is

$40,008,470. This funding decreased by $936,656 or 2.29%

due to declining real estate values. The School System’s local funding is calculated based on an agreed-upon funding

formula that shares 61.83% of all residential real estate, personal property and utility tax revenue. When these

revenues are declining, as they were this year, the School

System shares proportionally in the lost revenue.

Budget Challenges



 Committed Revenues: The total City revenue (excluding schools) has increased by $15.0 million. These revenues are displayed in the total general fund revenue category and are only available for designated programs and services. Major portions of this increase are attributable to specific state mandated Social Services programs ($1M); funding for Fort Monroe services ($2.4M); the transfer of CDA revenues for the Peninsula Town Center and H2O to the General Fund totaling $5,250,000 and $568,532 respectively; and cigarette tax increase for the new Fire Station 11 of $265,000. In addition to the obligated revenues, the City faced a reduction in current real estate tax revenues of $2.4 million as compared to the FY11 adopted budget based on a 2.7% residential assessment decline. An additional $600K reduction for the Disabled Veterans Tax Relief Program is also included.

The overall assessment decline is 1.7% due to an offsetting increase in commercial assessments. Consequently, current personal property taxes also increased by approximately $2.17 million to help offset the overall decline in current real estate taxes. The use of committed fund balance from departmental savings will be utilized to accomplish two significant initiatives that are one-time in nature. The first is a waterway investments/homeowners elevation revolving loan program for $2.5 million and the second is to fund a one-time performance payment to City employees for $1.6 million. Together these committed revenues total nearly $13.7 of the $15.0 million of the City’s budget increase.



 The expenditure side incorporates several required expenditures such as:

* Debt Service ($1.47M): This represents the projected increase for the repayment of bond principal and interest payments due in FY 2012.



* Employee Retirement and Benefits ($2.22M): This represents funding for the health insurance premium increasing approximately 5.1%, State mandated line of duty pay for public safety personnel and a recommended one-time performance payment on July 1, 2011 contingent upon a prescribed annual merit rating of three or higher.



2





* Positions and support cost for new Fire Station 11 – approximately $1

million: Funding for hiring of fifteen medic firefighters, part-time personnel and support cost for Fire Station 11 (Big Bethel Road) scheduled for completion in spring of 2012.



* Waterway investments/home elevation revolving loan program ($2.5M): This represents funding (utilization of designated fund balance) for residents living in flood zones which will provide a low-interest loan for the purpose of raising the finished first floor above the flood elevation. This program responds to a higher resident emphasis on the need for governmental efforts to address waterway management concerns of residents, doing so through a shared partnership between the public sector and the private homeowner. Other waterway investment opportunities can also be considered with this money.
