An 1826 American Beacon newspaper announced the formation of the Norfolk Jockey Club, which held races here until the late 1840s. It is believed that the Club&#39;s track was at Lamberts Point, in the vicinity of the present-day Powhatan Avenue and 42nd Street. In 1855, the clubhouse and stables of the track were converted into a hospital for victims of Yellow Fever.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Later in the century, racing tracks were established on what is now Colley Avenue, between 33rd and 34th Streets, and at the &quot;new Fair Grounds,&quot; which opened in 1872 in the Campostella section of Norfolk County. By 1900, there was a fair grounds and half-mile horse racing track near the present-day intersection of Tidewater Drive and Lafayette Boulevard, which was later used for racing motorcycles and automobiles. It operated until the 1950s.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The best known of them all was the mile-long track of the Jamestown Jockey Association, located off of Hampton Boulevard north of the present Terminal Boulevard (in the vicinity of the Exxon Corporation&#39;s gasoline tanks). This track operated for four years, holding races in April and October until Virginia Governor Harry Stuart closed it down for illegal betting in 1914.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c6">Source: Carroll H.
