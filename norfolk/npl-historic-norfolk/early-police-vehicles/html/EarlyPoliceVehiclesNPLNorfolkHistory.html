The patrol wagon was used to transport both wrongdoers and the sick and injured, and was christened &quot;Elizabeth Hudson,&quot; possibly following the custom of naming a new police vehicle after the first passenger to occupy it. The body of the new vehicle behind the driver&#39;s seat was a spacious 9 feet long and 5 feet wide, with more than 6 feet of standing room and a capacity of 14 passengers. It was cumbersome to drive and hard to corner, however, and in 1916 was replaced by the &quot;Tin Lizzie Fliver.&quot;</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2">Smaller than its stately predecessor, the little Fliver was easier to operate, but lacked leg space for the driver, and a stretcher patient much taller than 6 feet could be transported only by hanging his feet out the rear door. The Fliver&#39;s warning bell was neither loud nor distinctive, and its headlights worked only when the motor was running. Future upgrades would include modern wagons with bullet- proof steel sides and bullet-proof glass, which were added to the fleet in 1923.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7">Pages from Norfolk&#39;s Past are researched and written by Peggy Haile McPhillips, City Historian</span></p></body></html>
