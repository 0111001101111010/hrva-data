Residents of colonial coastal Virginia were very much aware of the weather -- to a people who lived near the water and derived much of their livelihood from the sea, a tropical storm was a noteworthy event. From them we learn of a 1667 hurricane which may have caused the widening of the Lynnhaven River and, in 1691, &quot;a most violent storm ... which stopped the course of ancient channels and made some where there never were any.&quot;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">During a hurricane in 1749, the Chesapeake Bay rose 15 feet above normal, a sand spit was washed up at Sewell&#39;s Point and, with the help of The Great Coastal Hurricane of 1806, Willoughby Spit was formed. Hatteras and Oregon Inlets were formed by a hurricane in 1846. Hurricanes in August &amp; September 1933 brought us wind speeds as high as 88 mph, extensive damage to cottages at Ocean View, water deep enough to float a boat on Granby Street after the storm had passed, and 18 deaths. Other memorable 20th century storms include Hurricane Hazel in 1954 and Donna in 1960.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">In 1951 hurricanes began to be named according to the phonetic alphabet (Abel, Baker, Charlie, etc). In 1953 it was decided to use women&#39;s names. Since 1979 both male and female names have been used.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">Source: Norfolk Department of Emergency Services</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Pages from Norfolk&#39;s Past are researched and written by Peggy Haile McPhillips, City Historian</span></p></body></html>
