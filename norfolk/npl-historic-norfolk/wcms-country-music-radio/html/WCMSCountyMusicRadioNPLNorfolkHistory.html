The first record played on WCMS was Bill Monroe&#39;s &quot;Blue Moon of Kentucky.&quot; By 1962, the station billed itself as &quot;America&#39;s Number One Country Music Station.&quot; FM transmissions were added in 1964 and the station played its one millionth record, &quot;Where Does the Good Time Go?&quot; by Buck Owens, in 1967. In the mid-1950s, WCMS produced a weekly live talent show using local performers. One singer was so outstanding that an audition record was made in the station&#39;s studios and sent to Capitol Records. The song, &quot;Be Bop A Lula,&quot; written by a WCMS disc jockey and recorded by Gene Vincent, became a million-seller, and led to the singer&#39;s appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">The station also brought nationally known country music stars to the Norfolk Arena. One of those artists was a Mississippi-born singer named Elvis Presley, who hitchhiked to Norfolk for his first appearance at the Arena as an opener for Hank Williams. Presley&#39;s association with Norfolk would continue into the 1970s -- &quot;Promised Land,&quot; the title song of an album released by the singer in 1975, is about Norfolk. WCMS was the first radio station in America to program country music full-time. Within 30 years, there were nearly 3500 country music stations in America, many of them patterned after WCMS&#39; format.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Pages from Norfolk&#39;s Past are researched and written by Peggy Haile McPhillips, City Historian</span></p></body></html>
