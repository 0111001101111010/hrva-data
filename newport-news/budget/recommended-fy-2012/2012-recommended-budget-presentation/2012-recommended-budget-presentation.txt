- Eliminated 5 positions and 6 trucks

- Retirement, Health Insurance and contractual obligations continue to increase

- Recommended change from weekly to bi-weekly Bulk Waste pickup (Same day as Recycling)

- Increased attention and manpower will be given to Community Maintenance effort, which is identified as one of City Council's Strategic Eight Initiatives Eliminated positions and other savings are not enough to offset increasing costs in Retirement, Health Insurance and contractual obligations for disposal and other charges; therefore, an increase is recommended in the weekly rate for FY 2012 as follows: Increase $0.27 per week for a standard 90 gallon container, or $14.04 per year

- Federally mandated Regional Consent Order continues to be a source of increasing costs for the Fund

- Certain contractual obligations and supply lines have been reduced

- Added 8 new positions, mainly in support of the mandated Regional Consent Order

- Retirement and Health Insurance costs continue to increase

- Added 2 new positions in anticipation of two new State mandated programs tentatively slated to begin in FY 2013

- Added an Attrition Credit of $300,000 to offset expense increases (an Attrition Credit reduces a Department’s budget based on an anticipated lag time between an employee termination and when a new employee is hired)

- With increased expenditures and corresponding offsetting expenditure savings it is recommended that the FY 2012 rate remain the same.
