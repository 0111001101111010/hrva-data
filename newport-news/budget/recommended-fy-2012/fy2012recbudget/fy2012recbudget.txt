REVENUES




   REVENUE ASSUMPTIONSFOR THE  FY 2012 ANNUAL OPERATING BUDGETINTRODUCTION There are over two hundred revenue items in the General Fund Budget.  This section summarizes the revenuecategories and offers insight on the items that are the major producers of City income.There are many economic and structural factors that determine the amounts of revenue that the City can expect toreceive in any fiscal year.  Economic variables that drive many of the revenues include short and long term interest rates,employment, personal income, consumer confidence, retail sales, and housing demands.  Structural determinants includepolicies and formulas developed by the state to distribute educational, social service, and other funds as well as regulations it places on the establishment and administration of local taxes and fees.This is all true for a “normal” fiscal year budget development process.  Over the past six fiscal years, the nationaleconomy could hardly be described as normal.  The extraordinary strength of the national and local housing markets overthe past several years and up to late 2008 was reflected in the rapid rise in housing values and the attendant increase insingle family real estate assessment revenue. This trend began to moderate in FY 2009, and the national recession hithard and quickly in September 2008, with the sub-prime housing market failure, and other ensuing connected fiscalassociations.  Deep expenditure reductions were made in FY 2009, to ensure that the City ended the fiscal year in apositive status, based on projected revenue shortfalls of almost $13 million in the General Fund.  Based on the cuts madein FY 2009, FY 2010 revenues were projected on a deepening recession, further revenue was lost from the impact of joblosses, and home foreclosures.  The FY 2011 revenue forecast was equally harsh, exhibiting for the first time the fullimpact on local revenues from the continuing failing housing market.  For those fiscal years, real estate assessmentswere anticipated to decline by an average of 5%, with a net loss of revenue from the General Fund’s largest single cashsource of $5.1 million.Several factors were considered as part of the revenue projections for upcoming fiscal year.  The base assumptionis that the recession will continue during FY 2012, and that due to the lag time in real estate reassessments, Real EstateTax revenues will show a marked decline from the current year.  FY 2012 reveals that while there are some increasesand decreases in residential assessments, the average residential assessment will decrease by an additional 2% overthe current year.  For commercial properties, this real estate tax revenue maybe lower due to lower assessments; the fullimpact of this change will be known by the first week of April.

FY 2012 Recommended Budget - Page 17




    Likewise, strong consumer retrenchment during the initial recession resulted in decreased yields from sales, meals, andlodging taxes and other retail oriented taxes.  Over the past 16 years this particular group of revenue sources providedthe City with the ability to weather economic downturns and unexpected financial obligations.  Unfortunately, the currenteconomic downturn has had a significant negative effect on these revenue sources.  While the City has been in thepreservation mode for the recent and past fiscal years, most revenue sources are showing signs that are consistent withthe performance of the current fiscal year, indicating a slow but steady recovery.  If these modest increases in theselocally generated taxes continue, the initially projected revenue could be better than estimated for the upcoming fiscalyear. State reimbursement for several programs continues to be a deep source of revenue reductions for the fifthconsecutive year.  State aid to localities for Human/Social Service programs, HB-599 Public Safety funding and StateCompensation Board reimbursements for the Constitutional Officers has been further reduced over this time period, bothduring the fiscal year and again with each new state budget adoption.  For the most part, while the State recognizes itobligation to reimburse localities for State responsible functions, it does not provide the necessary funding nor reduce theservice requirements. These reductions, coupled with declining local revenues have forced the City to make expenditurereductions which will impact service delivery to its citizenry.The Department of Budget Department and Evaluation employs several techniques to forecast the amount ofmoney a particular revenue source is likely to generate over the course of the fiscal year.  These include:<Historical trends over time - usually over no more than 18-24 months.<Analysis of previous years’ property tax delinquency patterns.<State and Federal notification of amounts that are provided for particular programs.<Projections of “usage” of a particular service that is fee-generating over the twelve month budget period.

Building Permit and Engineering Fees remain at very low levels, as the local economy continues its slow recovery.  While

potential exists for new commercial buildings, the downturn in new residential construction is projected to continue through FY 2012.  A

significant increase in Delinquent collections will be realized in Fire Emergency Medical Services due to contracting with a new collection

company.  This revenue category is highly responsive to economic changes. In addition, the State directed rate on the Right-of-Way UseFee (based on lane miles with the City) is increasing from the current rate of $0.76 to $0.83, generating $64,625 in additional revenue.Source

Approximately 16% of the revenue in this category is interest earned on cash balances of City funds.  With interest earningsat a national low, it is anticipated that very little revenue will be generated by this source in FY 2012, and shows the largest reductionfrom the FY 2011 estimate.  Participation Fees for soccer, football and basketball were added in the FY 2011 budget.  These fees areestimated to generate $125,000 in revenue for FY 2012, which will help to offset officiating costs for each event.  An increase in theHeath Building, Seafood Industrial Park and Managed Radio Tower rents constitute the remainder of the increase in revenue.Source

The revenues in this category consist of specific userfees charges.  Two major revenue sources that generate 80%, or $4,790,000 of this category are Clerk of Court Fees and EMS Fees.  For FY 2012, Clerk of Court Fees, which have historically proven to be stable regardless of economic conditions, are projected to decrease ($110,000) or(9.1%) from FY 2011.  EMS Fees are proposed to increase $275,000 or 8.0% over FY 2011.  Both of these revenue accounts are being adjusted toreflect actual collections in the current fiscal year.  In addition, EMS Bad Debt Collections are estimated at $210,000 or $170,000 more than thecurrent year based on prior year’s debt set-off recovery collections.  This revenue account was established in FY 2007 to recognize revenuesreceived from aged delinquent EMS Fees accounts.

Constitutional Officer operations; yet, the service level requirements by the State have not been reduced, thereby requiring the City to

$10,500,000The Non-Revenue Receipts category is comprised of two revenue sources for FY 2012.  The first is Return onInvestment from the Public Utilities Fund, which is recommended to decrease ($109,000) from FY 2011 amount of$10,000,000.  This is due to the first year of a three year reduction to refund the Public Utilities Fund for the purchase of landassociated with a potential road project.  The second revenue source is Payment from Wastewater - Consent Order.  In FY 2008, the General Fund loaned $3,500,000 to the Wastewater Fund to begin work on the Federally mandated RegionalConsent Order to identify and fix wasterwater system issues.  In FY 2011, the Wastewater Fund began repaying the GeneralFund for the loan provided.  FY 2012 represents year two of a five-year repayment plan.  This payment represents anaccelerated $250,000 more than planned repayment amount of $500,000, for a total FY 2012 reimbursement of $750,000.The decrease in this category is due to City Council approval of a Special Reserve Fund in October 2010.  An one-timeappropriation of $12 million was established from General Fund Reserves to create a stand alone funding source for anyplanned or non-recurring needs for technical/computer systems, development or redevelopment investments, debtreserves/pre-payment, infrastructure and emergencies.

FY 2012 Recommended Budget - General Fund, Continued The FY 2012 Recommended Budget reflects the second consecutive year of falling real estate assessments andstymied economic recovery due to the long national recession.  This dynamic has created another difficult budget year, inwhich operating expenses had to be cut, reduced, or eliminated due to continued State revenue cuts and declining realestate tax base.  While there appears to be consistent activity in the most economically sensitive local revenues thatimpact citizens directly (Sales, Meals, and Lodging Taxes), there has been modest growth in Machinery and Tools andPersonal Property taxes projected for FY 2012.  During the preparation of the Recommended Budget, each department gave a thorough evaluation of itsoperations to identify opportunities to reduce costs.  The result of this effort includes program and service reductions, andeliminations that will have direct impact on citizens. Increases have been budgeted for the cost of health insurance, vehicle and equipment fuel costs, and a salaryadjustment.  Again in FY 2012, a substantial increase has been budgeted for the City’s contribution to the Pension Fund,as the third year of an eight-year plan to continue progress toward meeting the Annual Required Contribution (ARC). Key funding issues for FY 2012 include:1.City Support to Schools had been increased from the FY 2011 amount of $109,200,000 to$112,200,000. This represents an increase of $3,000,000, or 2.7%.  This amount includes$14,412,231 in School Fund Debt Service paid by the General Fund.  As part of the Schools support,the General Fund will continue to provide $600,000 of Schools grounds maintenance funds and$2,409,570 for Information Technology support.2.The FY 2012 Recommended Budget includes the net elimination of seven full-time General Fundpositions. Two new positions were added for health and health and safety reasons, as detailed in theJuvenile Services Department description.  Additionally, existing Attrition Credit amounts wereincreased in several departments and new Attrition Credits were established to capture estimablesavings from vacant positions (an Attrition Credit reduces a Department’s budget for salaries andfringe benefits based on an anticipated lag time between an employee termination and when a newemployee is hired).

FY 2012 Recommended Budget - Page 41




FY 2012 Recommended Budget - General Fund, Continued 3.General Fund support for the City’s Debt Service will be $34,343,242.  This figure includes paymentsfor outstanding General Obligation Debt, Airport Debt Service of $545,875, and new bond issuecosts.  The Recommended Budget assumes a General Obligation bond issuance during FY 2012.4.Cash Capital, a component of the City’s adopted Capital Financing and Debt Management Policies,is budgeted at $2,894,246.  It is the intention to use funds from the Special Projects Fund to fully fundthe total cash requirement of $6,385,000 to satisfy  the FY 2012 requirement of 20% cash capitalgoal.  Cash Capital allows for current operating funds to be used to fund lesser expensive and moreregular capital investments (e.g., roof and HVAC replacements, and capital equipment) to decreasereliance on bond cash for shorter term capital projects.5.       A 2% salary adjustment has been budgeted for FY 2012.  This increase marks the first salaryadjustment in more than 36 months.  This cost is budgeted at $2.6 million in the Nondepartmentalcost center of the General Fund (and subsequently in each Special Revenue and Trust Fund).6.  Health Insurance premium rates for FY 2012 are anticipated to increase 5% effective December2011.  The resulting impact to the General Fund is a health care cost increase of $1.5 million.7.In FY 2007, the City began efforts to meet the goal of funding 100% of the actuarially determinedAnnual Required Contribution (ARC) to the Pension Fund in eight years.  The phased plan iscontinued in the Recommended Budget, with retirement contribution increases as follow: generalemployees - 22.8% (up from 21.0% in FY 2011); Fire, Police, and Sheriff employees - 29.7% (upfrom 26.4% in FY 2011); Waterworks employees - 24.8% (up from 21.9% in FY 2011).  TheRecommended Budget reflects approved changes to the City’s retirement plan that were adopted onMarch 1, 2010, and calculates retirement benefits for newly hired employees after this date at theVirginia Retirement System (VRS) rate. 8.  Fuel prices continue to trend higher for FY 2011.  The FY 2012 Recommended Budget assumes anaverage fuel purchase price of $3.05 cents per gallon, which is an 11.9% increase to the FY 2011budgeted per gallon rate.  The resulting FY 2012 impact to the General Fund is a fuel cost increaseof $340,892.

 - Increased Attrition Credit of nearly $7,000 offset increased health insurance and retirement costs, resulting in a net departmental increase of approximately $26,000 (an Attrition Credit reduces a Department’s budget for salaries and fringe benefits based on an anticipated lag time between an employee termination and when a new employee is hired).   Police

 – For FY 2012, seven Police Officer allotments that are unfunded in current year due to budget constraints will be fully funded, allowing for more sworn police officers providing direct citizen services.  Management level positions have been reduced by one (1) Police Captain allotment, to assist in funding the seven Police Officer positions above.  In addition, part-time and overtime funding have been increased slightly.  A corresponding increase in Attrition Credit has been added to the Department, to offset the additional expense (an Attrition Credit reduces a Department’s budget for salaries and fringe benefits based on an anticipated lag time between an employee termination and when a new employee is hired).

 - Utility, health service, food supplies, office and specialized police supplies have been reduced by a total of $243,229.  Additional Attrition Credit of $89,600 has been added to capture projected vacancy savings (an Attrition Credit reduces a Department’s budget for salaries and fringe benefits based on an anticipated lag time between an employee termination and when a new employee is hired).  Payment to the Regional Jail for inmates housed at that facility has been increased by $417,838 to cover $4 per diem increase for FY 2012, and for a higher projected average daily population growth, from 220 inmates to 225.    Adult Corrections

 - The Department will eliminate one (1) Building Maintenance Technician position ($61,627) in addition to reducing various line items, including food supplies and utility expenses ($20,000).   Juvenile Services

 - The Department continues to reorganize positions to more efficiently and effectively operate.  This reorganization includes the elimination of funding for one (1) management level position of Assistant Director, while retaining the position allotment.  Based on a FY 2010/2011 consultant study recommending additional Juvenile Services Counselor positions, the Department will add two (2) Juvenile Services Counselor positions.  Funding for these positions is offset by the Assistant Director reduction above.  Other reductions have been made to Temporary Contractual services, Telecommunications, and Repairs.

 - One (1) vacant Site and Subdivision Technician was eliminated ($46,043).  Reductions were made to Part Time staffing funding in the Civil Services, Technical Support, and Transportation Divisions ($40,000) as well as Overtime funding in the Architectural Division in the amount of ($14,662).  In addition, an Attrition Credit of ($50,000) was added to generate a departmental savings from vacant positions (an Attrition Credit reduces a Department’s budget for salaries and fringe benefits based on an anticipated lag time between an employee termination and when a new employee is hired).     Public Works

 - An Attrition Credit has been re-established in the amount of $350,000 (an Attrition Credit reduces a Department’s budget for salaries and fringe benefits based on an anticipated lag time between an employee termination and when a new employee is hired).  Other line items, including Utilities and Contractual Services, have been reduced netting an additional $50,000 savings.   Health

 - The Peninsula Health Department’s State Cooperative Budget Request was based on the premise that the Peninsula Health District will receive reduced

 State funding for FY 2012, increased contractual services for Lease costs, and no wage increase anticipated to be given to State employees.  In addition, it is anticipated that there will be no change in revenues from patient paid fees over the current year’s estimate.  Therefore, the Local Share Match based on the proposed Health Department State Budget request is $1,870,559.  This is a reduction from the current year of ($174,729), or (8.5%), less than the current budgeted amount of $2,045,288.  The FY 2011 amount is ($2,251), or (0.1%), less than the current year actual required amount.   With continued reduced State revenue to the Health Department, it is recommended that $120,000 be budgeted for in FY 2012 to support the Adult Services Dental Clinic program.  The Dental Clinic is a non-mandated function for the Health Department.  For FY 2010, 1,449 patients had 1,975 visits to the Clinic, with 94% or 1,362 of the patients Newport News residents.  This City amount will contractually fund 35% of the salary and fringe benefits cost of two dentist positions, and 100% of a third dental technician for $120,000 annually.  This cost would be 100% City cost, and not refundable through the State reimbursement process.  As the State continues reduce funding the Peninsula

 - The Hampton-Newport News Community Services Board’s FY 2012 request was $1,572,391.  The FY 2012 Recommended Budget includes no additional support and provides funding of $1,523,521, which is level with FY 2011 support.    Human Services

 - Expenditure adjustments were made to align budgeted spending with anticipated  FY 2012 program demand and service levels ($197,943 net increase).  General Fund Support/Local Match for Comprehensive Services Act (CSA) was reduced ($986,728), with the anticipation that any additional operating costs that might occur during the upcoming fiscal year will be funded by the CSA’s accumulated fund balance.  CSA Fund Balance will be used to offset the reduction to CSA General Fund Support.  The existing departmental Attrition Credit was increased $253,000 to capture vacancy savings (an Attrition Credit reduces a Department’s budget for salaries and fringe benefits based on an anticipated lag time between an employee termination and when a new employee is hired).     Parks, Recreation and Tourism

 - Various line items including Property Rental, Contractual Services, Travel/Training, Wearing Apparel, Educational/Training Supplies, Utilities, and Equipment Replacement/Repair were reduced totaling $314,789.  The existing departmental Attrition Credit was increased $139,594 to capture vacancy savings (an Attrition Credit reduces a Department’s budget for salaries and fringe benefits based on an anticipated lag time between an employee termination and when a new employee is hired).  Funding for events programming at the Downing Gross Cultural Arts Center was reduced ($35,500), with no anticipated changes to the performance schedules or offerings.

Termination of the Farmers Market operation will generate $95,924 of expenditure savings and includes the elimination of one full-time position.  Funding has been added to the Parks budget for partial-year operation of the Stoney Run Recreation Center in the amount of $139,000 that will allow for last quarter funding for potentially four positions and initial operations, should construction be favorably accelerated.   Libraries and Information Services

 - Elimination of the Bookmobile service will result in the reduction of two (2) Information Services Specialist positions and a savings of approximately $120,000.  The conversion of a Library Materials Specialist position to two part-time employees will reduce allotments by one and save nearly $5,000, while increasing the total number of service hours.  The Department will convert a part-time Digital Services Manager (Supervising Librarian B) to full-time, which will assist with growing demand for information technology services and programs provided by the library system.  This conversion will cost approximately $36,000.   Development

 - Elimination of an Administrative Support Clerical position.  The Department will reduce its Operating Expenditures in various line items by nearly $39,000.  As a result of lower bond interest expense and increased lease income at Rouse Towers, as well as lower maintenance and operating costs, the Department was able to reduce debt service expense and City Center Garage Maintenance expense by $105,545.  This is found in the Payments to Other Funds cost center of the General Fund.   Planning 

- Reductions were made to various operational expense lines totaling $22,341.  These reductions include the elimination of funding for Interns and decreased funding for Advertising, Contractual Services, Postage, Printing, and Repairs.

Other reductions include in the Reclassification Adjustments ($147,364), which decreases the funding available for city-wide position reclassifications that may occur after the FY 2012 budget has been adopted, in the Annual Police Academy Fee ($15,984) due to the City supporting its own training academy, in city-wide Organization Development Training ($15,025), in the elimination of funding for the 2600 Washington Avenue Building Lease ($50,419) that was used for the conversion to the City’s ERP programs over the past three years, and in various other operational line items ($3,502). In addition, the funding for the TNCC’s Workforce Development Center was transferred to the Community Support section of the operating budget ($93,643) to better reflect the nature of this expense.  These decreases were offset by the following increases:  funding for a 2% salary adjustment for employees ($2,600,000), Public Safety Promotional Testing ($118,000) for Police and Fire officer candidates, Development of City ($311,500) for the potential lease subsidy of Shipyard Headquarters at City Center, Virginia Power ($50,214) for streetlights and utility operation adjustments, Dues and Associated Memberships ($1,165).

 FY 2012 Recommended Budget – General Fund, Continued   ($117,731), Debt Service ($1,045,975), due to the fact that the City was able to proceed on current bond cash without having to have any new debt issue in FY 2011.  The one-time appropriation from the General Fund Reserves in the amount of $12,000,000 to establish a Special Reserve Fund (for unplanned/non-recurring needs and emergencies) occurred in the current fiscal year, and will not be repeated in the upcoming budget.  These reductions were offset by increases in the Enterprise Zone Benefit ($365,372) as additional companies becoming eligible for program reimbursements in FY 2012.  An additional contribution to the School Fund of $3,000,000 is also part of the increases in this division.
