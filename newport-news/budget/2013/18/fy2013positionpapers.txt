1  FY 2013 BUDGET POSITION PAPER  APRIL 2012  RETIREMENT FUNDING – SHIFT IN BUDGET ALLOCATIONS   In FY 2013, a significant change occurred in how Retirement costs for City employees are reflected in the annual operating budget.   The annual pension cost is a fundamental expense, whether through the City’s independent pension program or through participation in the Virginia Retirement System (VRS).  For that reason, all costs associated with retirement have been moved from the individual departments of the General Fund and consolidated in the Nondepartmental cost center.  (Retirement expense funding for all Special Revenue and Trust Funds remains in those Funds.)  This shift of expense allows for increased transparency as to the total cost of retirement expenses, an easier year-to-year-comparison moving forward and better fiscal control.  For this reason, the annual comparison of year-to-year activity between FY 2011, FY 2012, and FY 2013 is problematic.  In the Table below, the values for FY 2013 are shown adjusted for retirement costs removed from the Department.  The far column to the right of the page shows FY 2013 as if it included retirement costs, as in FY 2011 Actual and FY 2012 Revised columns.

1            FY 2013 BUDGET POSITION PAPER  APRIL 2012  TAXES AND REVENUE GENERATION   Issues

  There are many economic and structural factors that determine the amounts of revenue that the City can expect to receive in any fiscal year.  Economic variables that drive many of the revenues include short- and long-term interest rates, employment, personal income, consumer confidence, retail sales, housing demands, and most notably over the past few years, fuel prices.  Structural determinants include policies and formulas developed by the State to distribute educational, social service, and other funds as well as regulations it places on the establishment and administration of local taxes and fees.   This is all true for a “normal” fiscal year budget development process.  Over the past six fiscal years, the national economy could hardly be described as normal.  The extraordinary strength of the national and local housing markets that ramped up to late 2008 was reflected in the rapid rise in housing values and the associated increase in single family real estate assessment revenue. When the national recession hit hard and quickly in September 2008, the housing market failure connected with other fiscal conditions, impacting the City’s greatest source of revenue, the Real Estate Tax.  Declining real estate values resulted in loss of funds for the City that was further complicated by additional revenue lost from sources that were impacted by job losses and home foreclosures.  For fiscal years 2009 to 2012, the real estate levy dropped from $15.274 billion to $14.727 billion, or a loss of $547 million or 3.6% in value.  This resulted in a net revenue shortfall of $16 million in current Real Estate Taxes as the General Fund’s largest single cash source between FY 2010 and proposed FY 2013.  The General Property Tax category of revenue in the General Fund includes personal property and machinery and tools taxes, as well as monies generated from real estate taxes.  This category of funds represents approximately 55% of the City’s revenue stream annually. 




2   Further complicating a challenging revenue outlook, the City is anticipating additional revenue loss from the State.  Reimbursements from the State represent the second largest revenue source to the City and are projected to be lower by approximately $2 million for the fourth consecutive fiscal year.   Despite revenue from other local taxes showing signs of stabilization or moderate growth (e.g., Business, Professional, License taxes and other consumer taxes) it was projected that there would be overall lower funding in FY 2013 to support City operations based on the FY 2012 rate and fee levels.  With everything else constant, the City was expected to start the year with roughly a $13 million gap between revenue and expenses.   Cost increases of $9 million are anticipated and include the fourth year of the eight-year plan to increase the City contribution to the Pension system, higher health care and vehicle fuel costs, as well as preparing for opening the Denbigh Community Center, and partial-year operation of the 311 Customer Contact Center.  Additionally, the FY 2013 Recommended Budget provides a moderate wage increase to employees (of 1.5% in January 2013) and increased local support for Schools, an important expense, given the significant State funding cuts in recent years.      Over the last four years, the City has largely balanced the budget through cost reductions.  Nearly 5% of the workforce has been eliminated over the past four years, with an additional net reduction of 11 General Fund positions recommended for the upcoming fiscal year.  Operating expenses have been reduced in every department, with more cuts recommended for FY 2013.  However, the City is at the point where there are not enough cost decreases available to balance the budget without drastic service reductions.  Accordingly, the City Manager is recommending modest and targeted tax increases.  




3  With the real estate market still struggling, the City Manager is not recommending an increase in real estate tax rates.  Instead, tax rate increases are recommended in the following areas: personal property, meals, cigarette purchases, and the elimination of the cap on taxes for industrial utility consumption.  Ambulance fees are recommended to change to the same level as those of the City of Hampton, to facilitate the automatic mutual aid agreement that is being formulated to address fire and medical responses for citizens along the cities’ eight-mile common border.  In response to new Federal and State environmental regulations, certain user fees are also recommended to increase.  This is further detailed in a separate Position Paper on User Fees.  Funding Strategy

  The proposed rate and fee changes are:  raising the Meals Tax by 1%, the Cigarette Tax by ten (10) cents per pack of 20 cigarettes and the Personal Property Tax rate by twenty-five (25) cents.  Combined, the new revenue generated will be $5.7 million.  With the lower assessment on real estate property, most homeowners will be paying less net taxes in FY 2013 than in the current fiscal year.   Current Real Estate Taxes

  The real estate tax is the single largest source of income to the City providing over 37% of all General Fund revenues.  Property values are based on market values established for the 12-month period of October 1, 2010 to September 30, 2011.  The anticipated Real Estate Levy as of July 1, 2012 is expected to decline to a level that approximates FY 2008, valued at $14.1 billion dollars.  The average property assessment will decrease by 4.23%, resulting in a lower tax burden to citizens owning real estate.  This loss of real estate tax revenue reinforces the decision City Council made in May 2011 to change the tax abatement to a tax deferral program for elderly citizens.    In FY 2012, tax relief through this program cost the City close to $3 million in lost real estate tax revenue, with full City services provided to those participating in the tax relief program.  With a longer view in mind, this cost would have escalated over the next five years substantially, due to the fact that an estimated 40% of the City’s population will be considered elderly by 2030. However, as a result of the change, the FY 2013 estimate is only $2.2 million for the tax deferral program.    Other Local Taxes (Meals, Cigarettes, Personal Property, Utilities)

 The limited tax increases recommended are modest and not expected to materially impact citizens.    




4  Personal property taxes represent approximately 10% of the revenue stream for the General Fund.  Rates in FY 2013 are recommended to increase from $4.25 to $4.50 per $100 of assessed value.  This is expected to generate additional revenue of $2.4 million.  This tax affects all vehicle owners in the City and does not place a disproportionate tax burden on real estate property owners only.     Of the other tax increases recommended, the City’s meal tax is recommended to increase from 6.5% to 7.5%, generating additional revenue of $2.7 million.  For perspective, a $10 meal will cost citizens an additional ten cents in taxes.  The City’s tobacco tax is recommended to increase by ten cents from $0.75 cents per pack of 20 cigarettes to $0.85 cents.  This is expected to generate an additional $600,000 of revenue.  Finally, the current $80 monthly tax cap applied to industry for the consumption of electricity is recommended to be changed.  This will allow for the industrial tax cap to be altered thereby incrementally growing this revenue source without excessive impact on any one business.  This rate has not been adjusted since 1984.  Most surrounding localities either have no cap or a high maximum tax level.  Based on monthly kilowatt usage, this is expected to produce an additional $750,000 in General Fund revenue.  Impact

  Overall, the tax and user fee increases recommended are broad-based, not targeting any one specific segment of citizens.  Additionally, on average, the combined increases are not expected to exceed the net decrease that homeowners will realize from reduced property assessments.  Below is a chart that shows the potential impact on an average homeowner of all the rate and fee changes that the FY 2013 Recommended Budget contains.  This table is based on the values associated with a household of four, two cars, and an average 2012 real assessment of $200,000.     As the economy begins to improve, real estate taxes should begin to stabilize making the City’s fiscal challenges less onerous.  Although difficult to recommend, these tax increases contribute to the prudent fiscal policies the City is known for as evidenced by the strong Standard & Poor’s Rating (AA) that it receives annually.

1  FY 2013 BUDGET POSITION PAPER  APRIL 2012  USER FEE CHANGES AND IMPACTS   Overview

  The City was able to achieve a balanced budget for the upcoming fiscal year, after expenditure reductions were taken, and with some proposed fee and rate increases.  For the User Fund fees, the rate and fee increases are largely unavoidable.  Public Utilities (Waterworks) has continued to reduce operating expenses where possible, but these savings do not close the gap in revenue shortfalls due to declining water consumption.  For this reason, a Water Rates increase is recommended in FY 2013.  In the Wastewater (sanitary sewer) and Stormwater Management Funds, these rate increases are driven primarily by the impact of the Regional Consent Order and other environmental regulations.  As detailed in the recent presentations to City Council, the City’s requirement to reduce or eliminate sanitary sewer overflows and reduce the flow of pollutants into the local waterways will require prompt studies and substantial capital investment in system improvements over time.  The City has made every effort to reduce costs where possible, increase operational efficiencies, and use the reserves of the funds as appropriate.          Waterworks (Public Utilities)  Background

  During the FY 2012 budget process Waterworks presented information on customer demand reductions that have been experienced.  This trend has accelerated in the current fiscal year and makes budgeting for FY 2013 more difficult than anticipated.  Waterworks’ expenses are roughly 90% fixed (that is, they do not vary with water production levels) but approximately 80% of revenues are derived mostly from volumetric charges (that is, based on actual water usage).  The FY 2012 Budget achieved important goals of shifting some revenue from volume driven to fixed charges to reduce revenue sensitivity to changes in demand, eliminating the Summer Consumption Rate (SCR), and more equitably restructuring rates.  Building on the FY 2012 base, important targets for Waterworks FY 2013 Budget include:   “True Up” demand expectations and adjust rates accordingly  Continue to shift revenues incrementally from volumetric to fixed charges   Eliminate use of reserves to balance budget 




2   Maintain “austerity” approach to staffing, equipment, and projects  Waterworks’ FY 2013 proposed budget is ($1,443,000) or (1.7%) lower than the FY 2012 budget. To meet the need for increased revenue to support core operations with declining water demand, a continuation of the innovative water rate structure implemented for the current fiscal year is proposed.  Waterworks is recommending a moderate across-the-board increase to all customer class rates and to continue the second year of a multi-year program of raising monthly/bimonthly meter fees for small meter sizes to better reflect American Water Works Association (AWWA) hydraulic capacity ratios and include an adequate “readiness to serve” component.  All large meter fees were increased to include “readiness to serve” considerations for the current fiscal year.  This proposed rate structure, associated fee increases, and reductions in the recommended operating budget allow Waterworks to meet all four goals listed above for FY 2013.  It continues the past practice of regular, modest incremental increases that are highly favored by financial bond rating agencies, and are considered to be the key to long-term sustainability of an effective municipal water utility.  This, combined with a number of other financial practices, has enabled Standard & Poor's Ratings Services to reaffirm its rating of Waterworks revenue-secured bonds outstanding as 'AAA’.  Issues

  Demand continues to decline here and around the world due to a combination of:    Federal regulations that reduce water usage in plumbing fixtures and appliances  growing environmental/water conservation awareness by customers  demand elasticity to rising water costs  economic conditions  climate change as wetter conditions that reduce outdoor water usage is experienced    Waterworks’ demand is the lowest it has been in 32 years.  Demand is roughly the same today as in 1980 (around 37 million gallons per day or mgd) yet population served has increased from 344,000 to 421,000 (up 23%). Over the short-term, large industrial customer reductions have occurred (i.e., Giant refinery closure, and Anheuser Busch water efficiency improvements) causing usage per capita to drop from more than 108 gallons per day in 1980 to 88 gallons per day for all uses in FY 2012.  Future demand is projected to drop annually.  For the current fiscal year, water sales are budgeted at 41.8 mgd but current expectations for annual sales are only 37.5 mgd, 10.3% below budget and the lowest level since 1980.  Using the current fiscal year’s demand trends as a base, Waterworks’ 




3  operating budget for FY 2013 is proposed to decrease from $82,843,000 for FY 2012 to $81,400,000, a ($1,443,000) or (1.7%) reduction.  The estimated water sales volume for FY 2013 is 38.0 mgd, a 3.8 mgd reduction from budgeted sales for FY 2012, and close to actual sales expected for the current year.  Although Waterworks’ actual sales were routinely above 39.0 mgd each of the last twenty years, demand reductions are expected to continue for the near future at an estimated rate of 0.66% per year.  Strategy

  Waterworks eliminated 17 positions over the past four years reducing its total personnel count from 381 to 364.  Waterworks’ staffing has not been this low for more than 20 years.  In addition, Waterworks will continue the hiring freeze (approximately 30 equivalent full time positions are being held vacant) through the coming year and will closely monitor vacancies and budget progress throughout the year prior to filling any positions.  Waterworks’ recommended FY 2013 budget includes funding for the salary increase effective January 1, 2013.  Even with the salary adjustment cost, Waterworks salary expenses decreased almost 2.0% due to the full-time position reductions and lower salaries for new hires.   The proposed FY 2013 budget includes substantial increases occurring in retirement (32.3%) and health insurance benefits (10.5%).  Due to a refunding and restructuring of previously issued general obligation debt of 1998, 1999 and 2001 with lower interest rates, a savings in FY 2013 debt service will more than offset these fringe increases and was key to an overall budget reduction of $1.4 million.  Other than those noted above, all other expenses show a net increase of $40,000.  This year Waterworks must “true up” water sales expectations.  To forecast next year budget demand, Waterworks the history of the last 10 years actual sales activity coupled with FY 2012 expectations.  Past sales data were adjusted to take into account permanent changes that affect the outcome such as the Refinery will not reopen and industry will not return to less water-efficient operations; and other long-term trends will continue.  This resulted in a level of 38.0 mgd in water sales expected for FY 2013.  To reinforce these results, modeling of other historical data by Waterworks’ financial consultant (Raftelis) supported this projection.  Waterworks FY 2013 revenues at existing fees/rates and with demand budgeted at the 38.0 mgd level will not provide revenues sufficient to finance operating expenses or eliminate the current fiscal year’s budgeted contribution from reserves of $1.0 million.  Modest across-the-board increases in water rates are recommended for all three customer classes to remedy this.  In addition, the second year of a multi-year program of raising fixed bimonthly and monthly service fees for smaller meters (5/8”, ¾” and 1”) is recommended to ultimately better reflect cost of service. Larger meters above 1” were brought up to cost of service levels in FY 2012.  This process establishes a 




4  reasonable and adequate rate structure and approach that allows maintaining reserves and to avoid major infrastructure failures in the future.    Recommended rates are:   Single-family Residential (bimonthly)  R1 – lifeline rate – 0 to 6 HCF    $3.14/HCF  R2 – normal use – 6 to 50 HCF  $3.60/HCF  R3 – conservation tier –  50+ HCF  $7.20/HCF   Industrial (monthly)  I1 – first tier – 0 to 40,000 HCF  $3.60/HCF  I2 – second tier – 40,000+ HCF  $3.14/HCF   General Rate (mostly monthly)  G – All usage     $3.60/HCF   Waterworks’ single family residential customers use an average of 162 gallons per day.  For a 60-day, bimonthly billing cycle this equals a billable consumption of 9,900 gallons or just over 13 hcf.  Waterworks is keenly aware of the financial constraints facing its customers and continues to emphasize sustainable approaches to minimize rate increase impacts on residents while maintaining reasonable rates for business and industry.  Residential customers will experience:   Increase fixed meter fee - $0.60/month   “Lifeline” customers using 6 hcf or 75 gallons per day- $1.35/month total increase for a new monthly “bill” of $13.77 for water only   “Average” customers using 13 hcf or 162 gallons per day - $2.33/month total increase for a new monthly “bill” of $26.37 for water only    Block 3 continued with increase (>50 hcf or 623 gallons per day) for excessive water use in lieu of SCR  Despite the FY 2013 rate/fee increases discussed, Waterworks still remains one of the lower cost water utilities in Southeastern Virginia and even with the proposed increases compares favorably to those of most other water and wastewater utilities in the region, state and nation.       




5  Solid Waste Fund  Issues

  Overall, the expenses in the Solid Waste Fund are decreasing; however, the cost of operating, maintaining and replacing equipment has risen significantly, thus keeping total costs up.  On the revenue side, delinquency rates and non-payment of fees are significant problems.    Funding Strategy

  The proposed increase of 10 cents per week will raise the fee for a 90-gallon container from $5.65 to $5.75 per week or $5.20 per year.   A focused effort will be made in the upcoming fiscal year to examine methods of minimizing delinquency rates and non-payment of fees.  Impact

  The Solid Waste fund increase will provide the necessary funding to maintain current services.  The average household with one 90-gallon container will experience an additional cost of $5.20 per year.    Stormwater Fund  Issues

  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is exerting significant pressure on Virginia and other Chesapeake Bay watershed States to convert to much more stringent and direct measures of discharged pollutants.  These changes are embodied in two major components of the Stormwater Management Program:   The Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) permit   Chesapeake Bay Preservation Act Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDL)  MS4 Permit The MS4 is the overall permit issued to Newport News by the State under EPA guidance for stormwater management.  The last permit expired in 2006; the City has since been operating on annual extensions, largely because the region and state objected to proposed EPA requirements.  A new draft MS4 permit will be issued sometime in 2012.  The City has reviewed the draft permit for Fairfax County, VA and recently-issued permit for Washington, D.C.  As a result, it is anticipated that many of the 




6  provisions contained within these permits, including increased monitoring, inspection, record keeping, and enforcement will be typical for the permits issued to the Hampton Roads localities.  These additional provisions will represent an increased cost of operations to the City.  Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) The Chesapeake Bay Preservation Act calls for increasing regulation of nutrients and sediment.  EPA’s approach is a “Bay Diet” prescribing limits on nutrients (phosphorous and nitrogen) and sediment. These limits are defined as Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDL).  The State and EPA were at odds over this approach for several years, but reached a consensus agreement in December 2010.  TMDL agreements will eventually become part of MS4 permits and related regulations.  The effort is multi-leveled; by working with the industry, the region, lobbyists, and the City Attorney, the intention is to minimize these impacts to the extent practicable.  As with the MS4 requirements,   the additional TMDL provisions will represent an increased cost of operations to the City.  Funding Strategy

  The Departments of Engineering and Public Works have joint operations for the Stormwater Management Fund.  The FY 2013 recommended Stormwater User Fee is $7.45/ERU, which is a $2.00 per month increase over the current rate of $5.45/ERU.  The average household cost will increase by $24.00 per year to $89.40.  The FY 2013 budget presents the best estimate of the necessary expenses to address the increased tracking and monitoring required by the anticipated MS4 permit including TMDL.  The City will continue to evaluate existing and proposed operations to identify opportunities for cost control.    Impact

  The Stormwater User Fee increase will provide the necessary funding to appropriately respond to the increasing regulatory requirements anticipated with the new draft MS4 permit.  For the average household, there will be an increased cost of $24.00 annually.   Wastewater Fund  Issues

  Traditionally the Sewer User Fee has been based on operational costs, including capital project debt service and regulatory impacts.  This year, however, it is necessary to 




7  recommend a rate that is established solely by regulatory guidelines in the City’s Special Order by Consent (SOC) with the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ).  The next phase of the SOC requires development of a Rehabilitation Plan for system repairs, upgrades and rehabilitation following the affordability clause of the SOC.   The initial estimate for rehabilitation plan costs is $240,000,000 over the next twenty years.  The DEQ has historically suggested that a sewer system is “affordable” if the annual cost to operate repair and maintain the sewer system does not exceed 1.25% of the locality’s Median Household Income.  The determination of how much a jurisdiction must invest in the sewer system is known as the Affordability Index (AI).  In Hampton Roads, the AI includes costs charged by Hampton Roads Sanitation District (HRSD, a political subdivision of the State).  The DEQ has recently indicated that it will set the floor of the AI at 1.5%.  It is currently projected that the City’s costs will exceed the limits of the AI.  This means that the City will be required to set sewer rates at the limit of affordability and complete whatever projects can be accomplished within that limit.  Based on a DEQ required investment of 1.5% of MHI, a rate increase of 70% from the current average annual rate of $198 per household to an average annual rate of $332 per household will be required.  The combined City and HRSD rate (a rate to be set by HRSD, and not by the City) would increase from $424 per year to $721.      Funding Strategy

  The recommended Sewer User Fee for FY 2013 is $2.79 per hundred cubic feet (hcf) of water consumption.  (This amount represents the combined rate of the base rate plus the Surcharge rate. Beginning in FY 2013, the base and Surcharge rates will be represented as one unified rate.)  This is a 10 percent increase over the existing rate of $2.53 per hcf.  The average increase per household is estimated to be $1.95 per month or $23.40 per year.  This will be the first incremental increase required to achieve the required investment of 1.5% MHI.     Impact

  The Sewer User Fee increase will provide the necessary funding to begin to appropriately respond to the increasing regulatory requirements being established by the DEQ.  The average increase per household is estimated to be $1.95 per month or $23.40 per year.   




8  Conclusion

  When taken in isolation from other actions in the budget, the user fee increases may be considered hefty.  However, when balanced with the savings generated by lower real estate assessments for most homeowners, there are projected to be net savings to most citizens. Below is a chart that shows the potential impact on an average homeowner of all the rate and fee changes that the FY 2013 Recommended Budget contains.  This table is based on the values associated with a household of four, two cars, and an average 2012 real estate assessment of $200,000.  With the average decline in real estate assessments, the typical homeowner will actually have an overall lower tax burden than in the current fiscal year.

1  FY 2013 BUDGET POSITION PAPER APRIL 2012 NEW INITIATIVES / PROGRAM CHANGES  Overview

  During the development of the Recommended Budget, it was clear that the City would be faced with even more critical fiscal challenges in FY 2013.  During a period of the fourth consecutive year of declining revenue, these challenges would include funding the start-up costs for two large projects that will come to be operational in the upcoming fiscal year.  While there were necessary program reductions to fit within the smaller revenue picture, there were limited program enhancements.  The implementation of program changes are for the most part both innovative and cost saving will have minimal or no impact on services, and addresses aspects of the Strategic 8 Priorities.     New Initiatives

  There are two major initiatives that will come to fruition during FY 2013.  The first new initiative is the Denbigh Community Center, a $15 million capital project in the northern district of the City.  The 50,000 square-foot building includes classrooms, two full-size gymnasiums, and a teen center and will serve as the flagship in support of the Upper Warwick Boulevard Corridor Strategic Priority.  Partial-year funding for positions and initial startup costs are included in the current year budget of $139,594 to allow for the appropriate outfitting and equipping of this facility.  In FY 2013, funding has been added for a full year of operations for the Denbigh Community Center in the Parks, Recreation and Tourism budget in the amount of $701,661, which includes three (3) new staff positions.  This amount encompasses the amount of $139,594 in the FY 2012 budget.  Inclusive of the costs budgeted in the Departments of Public Works and Information Technology, the full cost of operations at the Denbigh Community Center is $720,829 for FY 2013.   The operation of the 311 Customer Contact Center, anticipated to open in January 2013, is the second new initiative that will be funded in the upcoming fiscal year.  Directly supporting the City’s Customer Service Strategic Priority, the 311 operation will be housed in space that is available at the Peninsula Health District building.  This location is optimal for several reasons.  Situated in the center of the City, the space is remote from the current 911 Dispatch Center and can serve as an alternative dispatch site, should the need arise.  This building has its own generator and dedicated pump station 




2  and will be able to operate during times of emergency, eventually becoming the Emergency Information Center during crisis events.    This new function will change and improve the way that the City communicates with its customers, with the 311 Customer Contact Center providing a “one-stop-shop” to answer questions and receive citizen concerns and issues.  The amount of $35,519 was included in the FY 2012 budget for partial-year funding of one position.  The Recommended Budget includes $332,508 for this operation, which represents an increase of $296,989 over FY 2012.  This includes funding for six full-time positions and part-time staff ($304,582).  Three positions will be shifted from the Information Technology, Codes Compliance, and Engineering Departments.  Vacant positions in these departments were allocated to the 311 Customer Contact Center, as they represent the majority of daily calls to the City in some manner.  The remaining funds will be used for overall operating expenses such as Contractual Services, Telecommunications, and Supplies ($27,926).   Program Changes - Innovations

  The Fire Department is in collaboration with the City of Hampton on two shared service programs, with these areas being utilized for savings in both localities in FY 2013.  First is the consolidation of Logistic Functions to combine the warehouse functions and personnel of both cities into one site to create efficiencies, reduce personnel, and create savings through bulk purchases.  Savings here represents the elimination of one (1) Firefighter position ($58,280) in a future fiscal year and anticipated bulk purchase savings of ($23,000) in FY 2013.  Second is the Automatic Mutual Aid between the two Fire Departments along the eight-mile common border of Hampton and Newport News to allow the closest available unit (fire or medic) response for calls for service by the public.  Three stations in both cities mirror each other along the City line.  Once implemented, the mutual aid response time will be reduced for both cities and in time could result in the elimination through attrition of twelve (12) Firefighter positions for an anticipated savings of up to $700,000.  For FY 2013, all positions are retained for both of these programs to allow for the phasing in of operations.  Combined, both initiatives could eventually generate savings of $782,000.    As a companion piece for this mutual aid function to work with seamless fluidity to the citizens, it is recommended that both Hampton and Newport News have uniform Ambulance Fees.  That way both localities will receive like payments for the same service, and the citizen will not be charged differing rates.    The Juvenile Services Department is another area of strong innovation.  The Department continues to reorganize positions to more efficiently and effectively operate.  Part of the reorganization for FY 2013 focuses on a new Medical Service 




3  Contract for Secure Detention at a cost of $386,580.  This new contract will enhance the services provided to the juveniles in the facility and reduce the liability to the City.  The funding for this contract would come from the elimination of two (2) filled Registered Nurse positions ($144,644), and one (1) filled Licensed Practical Nurse position ($51,499), and the elimination of the current Medical Service Contract ($47,875) that is found in the Nondepartmental-Contingencies division of the General Fund.  The filled City positions being affected by this contract will have the opportunity to work for the contractor if they so desire.  Reductions in Medical and Lab supplies, Prescriptions, Professional Health Services, and other health care-related items ($114,613) complete the reductions and offset the cost of the new contract.    With the operation of the South Morrison facility functioning for a year now, we are looking for other opportunities to invest in expanding similar City functions into this central location.  In FY 2013, $75,000 is budgeted for the South Morrison School Work Force Development Center.  This will provide funding for a SNAP location, after-school programs for homeless children (those who are identified as living in hotels and other temporary housing), a small library outreach center, as well as an additional site for general work force development programs.    The Public Works Department has created a Sustainability Division in an effort to enhance the City’s “Green” initiatives, by adding one new position ($46,606) and reclassifying another, which will improve energy efficiencies and enhance environmental causes and address the City’s’ Sustainability Strategic Priority.     Service Impacts

  The Bookmobile has been recommended to be eliminated from the Libraries and Information Services Department in FY 2013.  Since the beginning of the fiscal year, the Bookmobile vehicle has experienced major mechanical failures and has been patched together to remain operational.  The amount of time that it has been off the road has impacted service delivery to its patrons.  The initial estimate last year was that the vehicle would function for two more years.  That lifespan has been cut in half with the costly repairs that we are now facing.  Elimination of this Library function will result in the reduction of one (1) filled Information Services Specialist position and part-time funding, with a savings of $100,000.   In the Historical Services Fund, one (1) filled Historic Site Curator ($58,416) position has been recommended for elimination.  By this action, tours of the Newsome House will be by appointment or event only.  This decision was based on extremely low visitation experienced by the facility.

1  FY 2013 BUDGET POSITION PAPER  APRIL 2012  SCHOOLS FUNDING   Overview

  The school divisions in Virginia have no taxing authority and are not fiscally independent.  Therefore, they must rely on Federal, State, and local governments to fund their Operating Budget requirements.  Deciding the level of local support for the City’s public school system becomes one of the most significant budgetary policy points in the development and final adoption of the annual Operating Budget.   Issue

  In Virginia, a significant portion of local schools revenue is State funding that is received through sales tax revenue apportionments, basic aid to support the Standards of Quality (SOQ), and other incentive-based or categorical revenues approved by the General Assembly during its biennial budget considerations. Under State policy, the local government is required to contribute at least a minimum level of funding that is determined by a Required Local Effort (RLE), which computes the locality’s ability to pay for education.  The RLE is calculated for Standards of Quality funding, based on March average daily membership (ADM) projections.  For FY 2012, the minimum Required Local Effort required by the City of Newport News is $41,588,948.  However, the City actually will contribute $112,200,000, which includes $12.4 million in City-supported School Fund debt service.  This additional $70,611,052 in City funding represents the recognition that the State has not fully funded its SOQ obligations and, that even if it did, this amount of State funding would not be sufficient to support the level of educational services desired in this community.  In developing a recommended Operating Budget, the School Superintendent each year must determine new or changed funding the School Division can expect to receive from the State, from Federal Impact Aid, and from other miscellaneous revenue. The difference between the revenue sources and the School’s base operating needs, plus additional funding for any new initiatives, becomes the foundation for the request for local funding.  In reality, the amount of local funding requested is often tempered by the School Division’s understanding of the extent to which the City’s General Fund resources may change from one fiscal year to the next.  




2  The process of determining a distribution of existing and new revenues between a localities’ School Division and the municipal government becomes a fundamental decision in the annual budget process.  In some Virginia localities this is accomplished by agreeing in advance on a funding formula, the complexity of which varies among jurisdictions.  In most localities, however, this determination is made annually by the governing body by considering their City Manager’s recommendation and the amount of the request made by the elected School Board.  In arriving at a distribution decision, the City Manager and governing body evaluates the funding requirements for their municipal operation and weigh these against the financial needs of their School Division.  This would be the normal course of action prior to FY 2009.  In early September 2008, the national economy changed course in a downward direction.  National trends continue to directly impact State and local revenues to both the City and Schools in a constantly fluctuating manner, resulting in consecutive years of budget reductions made necessary by the ever-declining revenue picture.  Rather than discussing the shared revenue growth, the analysis shifted to sharing the impact of lost revenue.  Prior to the 2008 recession, the greatest increase in State funding has come in the first year of the State’s biennium budget.  In the second year of a biennium budget, it would have been reasonable to project that the Superintendent’s Recommended Budget would contain State revenues at least equal to the first year.  Beginning in late 2008, reductions in State support have occurred annually, with the school districts sustaining deep reoccurring State revenue cuts.  While a certain percentage of the reductions can be directly tied to declining enrollments in the City’s school system, other cuts stemmed from the State reducing payments to Schools in order to balance their own revenue shortfalls. From the FY 2009 actual revenue to the FY 2012 adopted budget, Schools revenue from the State has declined $34.0 million, from $194.8 million to $160.8 million.  During the budget developmental process, the Governor’s submitted revised budget for biennial years FY 2012-2013 again included additional losses for FY 2013 of approximately $2.2 million.  In past fiscal years, an informal funding formula has been used to estimate the City’s Local Share Contribution.  In general, new revenue growth was shared between the City and Schools, after the amount was discounted by those General Fund revenue sources restricted for use for specific purposes, such as debt service.  (Debt service obligations, whether for School or City projects, must be met before revenues can be legally used for any other purpose, and the funding for these obligations was subtracted from the formula before identifying what is available for discretionary School or municipal spending.)  With annual declining revenue during the recession, no attempt was made to apply a formula in the current fiscal year or for the proposed budget for FY 2013.  Early in 




3  budget development process, the City Manager advised the Schools Superintendent of the intention to recommend an increase in funding to Schools.  The final amount of the increase is $1.2 million more in FY 2013 than in FY 2012, or $113,400,000, or a 1.1% increase.    This additional funding from the City to Schools will help to support the increases in employee benefits costs, such pension costs associated with those employees in the City’s retirement system, and increase health insurance costs.  Other revenue amounts for Newport News Schools are minimally changed in Federal Funds, at $4,791,582 ($700,000 more than the current year) and a decrease in other locally generated revenues (tuition, athletic fees, etc.) of $340,000, bringing the FY 2013 estimate for this source to $1,605,500.   Funding Strategy

  The City’s total General Fund revenue for FY 2013 is projected to marginally decrease by $330,000 or 0.1% from the FY 2012 Adopted Budget.  Since FY 2009, General Fund revenues have declined 4.5%.  Consequently, there is essentially no discretionary spending in the General Fund.   Below is a chart detailing Schools revenue and expenditure categories for FY 2013, displayed as the School Board Proposed budget.  The total amount for the Superintendent’s Recommended and School Board Proposed budgets remained the same, with some funding adjustments made by the School Board in the Instructional, Transportation, Operations and Technology categories.  The overall revenue change between FY 2013 and FY 2012 reflects projected reductions in State revenue.

  Impact

 The City Manager’s Recommended FY 2013 City Operating Budget provides for $1.2 million more than the FY 2012 level for Schools.  The total FY 2013 Local Support for Schools is proposed at $113,400,000.  At the time of the final preparation of the City Manager’s recommended budget, the Governor’s Proposed biennial included a reduction in School funding of $2,196,709.  Once a final State budget is adopted, any funding changes from that source will be incorporated in the final budget slated to be adopted in May 2012.    




 




1  FY 2013 BUDGET POSITION PAPER APRIL 2012 EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION AND POSITION CLASSIFICATION  Annual Salary Adjustment

  In the City’s annual operating budget, the largest portion of funds is dedicated to salaries and fringe benefits, as it takes employees to deliver services to citizens.  For FY 2013, this cost is approximately $182.5 million or 44% of the Recommended Budget.  During difficult financial conditions, employee compensation and benefits are areas where localities look to reduce or eliminate costs.  This is evidenced by actions in some of the neighboring localities and in other areas throughout the nation.  From FY 2009 to FY 2012, through attrition and a hiring freeze, the City was able to avoid massive lay-offs, furloughs, salary reductions, and costly early retirement buy-out programs.  The last annual pay adjustment provided to regular full-time employees, effective July 1, 2011, granted a 2% general wage adjustment.  This was the first salary adjustment that employees received in a 36-month period, or since July 1, 2008.  In July 2010, a one-time payment of $500 was provided to regular full-time employees hired prior to December 31, 2009, in recognition for continuing to provide efficient and effective services, both to citizens and to internal clients during this time of economic stress.  It also was intended to help offset a rise in the employees’ portion of health insurance premiums.    From FY 2009 to FY 2013 inclusive, 273 positions have been eliminated or are recommended to be cut from the operating budget.  This represents a reduction in positions of almost 5%.  At the same time there have been reductions in Part Time and Temporary staffing funds.  While there have been some positions added to the complement, new position additions were limited in scope or were necessary for full operation of a facility (e.g., 12 positions were added for the opening of the Brentwood Fire Station in FY 2012).  Ultimately, these personnel cuts required the remaining employees to perform additional duties with no increased compensation.      Departmental organizational restructuring has been encouraged throughout the City to accommodate the shifting of the workload. The City’s employees have worked diligently in support of the organization’s mission and goals despite the professional and personal challenges all have experienced in dealing with a troubling economy.  The City’s workforce has remained highly competent and motivated to provide efficient and effective services to citizens on a daily basis.    




2  In recognition of the effort of employees to carry on the mission despite the challenges of reduced resources and greater personal workload and stresses, it is recommended that effective January 1, 2013, all regular full-time employees, including Constitutional Officers and Appointed Officials, receive a general wage adjustment of 1.5%.  The General Fund expenditure budget increase for salaries in FY 2013 is $1 million.  All other operating funds (user fee and special operating funds) also incorporated a 1.5% January 1, 2013 salary increase for the upcoming fiscal year.    Compensation Study

  While there are continuing economic challenges, it is important to address employee compensation to remain competitive in the marketplace, within the fiscal constraints of the City’s budget.  As a result, during FY 2012 the City contracted with the Archer Company, an outside consultant, to provide an objective review of the City’s classification and compensation plan. The overall goal of the study is to ensure that there is internal equity and ensure the City is competitive in the marketplace for attracting and retaining qualified employees.  The recommended implementation of the study’s findings and the resulting  cost will be a phased approach over multiple fiscal years, starting with FY 2013, as funding allows.   Reclassifying Positions

  In order to accommodate the reductions in the workforce, departmental organizational restructuring continues to occur throughout the City to manage the workload and maintain existing service levels.  The position classification of an individual is a means of evaluating a filled or vacant allotment to ensure the assigned duties and responsibilities are properly graded and grouped with similar level positions across the City.  For the FY 2013 budget, a proactive approach was taken and potential position reclassification changes were solicited from departments during the budget preparation process as a result of this restructuring.  Potential pay grade changes to positions as a result of increased responsibilities were identified early in the process, enabling the Human Resources Department to review requests, and the Budget and Evaluation Department to calculate the cost of the potential changes.  On an ongoing basis, operating departments will review positions to determine if efficiency and productivity can be gained through position reclassifications.  As a result, $153,681 has been budgeted in the General Fund Nondepartmental cost center to allow for the change in the value of positions as reclassifications are completed, and that may occur during the fiscal year.  This pool is to be used in the event that the increased salary and fringe benefit costs could not be absorbed by the position’s operating department.  




3  Pension Contributions

   Consolidation of Pension Costs In FY 2013, a significant change occurred in the representation of Retirement costs for City employees in the annual operating budget document.  The annual pension cost is a fundamental expense, whether through the City’s independent pension program or through participation in the Virginia Retirement System (VRS).  For that reason, all costs associated with retirement have been moved from the individual departments of the General Fund and consolidated in the Nondepartmental cost center.  (Retirement expense funding for all Special Revenue and Trust Funds remains in those Funds.)  This shift of expense allows for increased transparency as to the total cost of retirement expenses, an easier year-to-year comparison moving forward and better fiscal control.         For this reason, the annual comparison of year-to-year activity between FY 2011, FY 2012, and FY 2013 is problematic.  In the Recommended Budget, in the numeric detail of the budget, the values for FY 2013 are shown adjusted for retirement costs removed from the Department.  On page 46 of the document, under the blue tab Expenditures, the table shown displays the comparison of the departmental budget history, with and without the retirement costs associated with them.  The far column to the right of the page shows FY 2013 as if it included retirement costs, as in FY 2011 Actual and FY 2012 Revised columns.  This same table is found at the beginning of this series of Position Papers.  FY 2013 Pension Contributions  The City is firmly committed to an eight-year obligation to incrementally increase its contribution to the Newport News Employees Retirement Fund (NNERF) Annual Required Contribution (ARC) to the Pension Fund.  FY 2013 will be the fourth year in this process.  This is a fundamental expense of the operating budget and the recommended budget includes a substantial increase in our annual and sustainable contribution to the pension system.  The annual contribution is recommended to increase from $22.7 million to $28.9 million City-wide, representing $6.2 million in additional funding.  This amount is consistent with the City’s plan to completely restore the actuarial position of the pension fund over time.  The recommended amount brings the contribution up to 65% of the ARC from 59% in the current year. 




4    In addition to the (NNERF) system, the City also participates as a member of the Virginia Retirement System (VRS).  The City fully funds the annual VRS contribution for those employees hired or rehired after March 1, 2010 or who elected to shift from the City’s pension system.  As more of the work force participates in VRS, so grows the annual contribution.  This fact, plus the change in the VRS actuarial assumptions for the upcoming fiscal year, increased the General Fund payment from $1.5 million to $2.8 million.    As the Recommended Budget was readied for distribution, the State General Assembly concluded its regular session without an adopted budget, causing significant uncertainty as to the impact of the State funding to localities in the near future.  Most distressing of all is the late-breaking adoption of a conferee bill that requires employees of localities enrolled in the Virginia Retirement System (VRS) to pay a 5% contribution toward retirement and stipulates that those same employees receive a salary adjustment of 5% to offset the cost.  This new State mandate comes at a time when a majority of localities are nearly complete with their budget processes.  In addition, it does not recognize the innate inequity in employee salaries that it would create in localities such as ours that maintain both a local retirement system, as well as participation in VRS.  Depending on what action the General Assembly takes in this matter in coming days, it may be necessary to adjust the budget to reflect this new mandate.

1  FY 2013 BUDGET POSITION PAPER  APRIL 2012  POSITIONS:  ELIMINATED, TRANSFERRED, AND NEW    Overview

 FY 2013 is the fourth consecutive year of reduced revenue from two of the City’s largest revenue sources, Real Estate taxes and State revenue to localities.  The City’s Real Estate Assessed Valuations fell by nearly $600 million from FY 2012 to FY 2013.  This drop in valuations will result in a loss of more than $7.2 million in revenue to the City.  This reduction, coupled with necessary increases in funding to retirement and health care resulted in the need for significant budget reductions.  Consequently, one of the City Manager’s FY 2013 budget process directives to departments was to review their current staffing levels and structure with the intent of reducing personnel costs.  Wherever practicable, greater use of part-time, temporary and contractual employees, job sharing and overtime was encouraged to save funds.  Since the City has been under a partial hiring freeze for all of FY 2012, all vacant positions were scrutinized for elimination during the budget process and attrition credits were again utilized to achieve savings (an attrition credit reduces a department’s budget for salaries and fringe benefits based on an anticipated lag time between an employee termination and when a new employee is hired).  Minimizing layoffs was another objective.   Issues

  Position Reductions To offset the overall reduced General Fund revenue and coupled with necessary increases (to retirement, healthcare, as well as funding an additional $1.2 million to Newport News Public Schools), the City Manager found it necessary cut over $7 million from the City’s General Fund expenditures.  Personnel costs make up nearly 44% of City’s General Fund overall budget.  To achieve the required significant cost savings, reductions in personnel were unavoidable.  In total, 21 positions are recommended for elimination from the General Fund with an additional two positions being transferred to other user fee-supported funds.  Unfortunately, 11 of the 21 positions slated for elimination are filled with current City employees; the 10 remaining positions are vacant.  In the user fee-supported funds, one filled position and one vacant position are also recommended for elimination bringing the total number of eliminated positions to 23.  Table One below details, by department and position, specific changes made to the General Fund staffing for FY 2013.  Regrettably, Personnel reductions are not new to the City.  Over the past four fiscal years the City has reduced full-time staff by more than 




2  200 positions with a net reduction of 138 after appropriately adding positions for strategic initiatives such as the new Brentwood Fire Station.  In accordance with City policy, the City Manager will announce a Reduction-In-Force (RIF) immediately after the FY 2013 budget is adopted by City Council.  The process of implementing the RIF with respect to occupied positions will require coordinated activities between department heads and the Department of Human Resources.  The Department of Human Resources staff will work with affected employees to determine if they can be placed in a vacant position in the City for which they are qualified.  In situations where such a placement is unsuccessful, the Human Resources Department will offer additional placement services such as resume’ writing assistance and employment counseling.  Public Safety Issues A special situation exists in the Fire Department for FY 2013.  The Manager is recommending instituting an automatic mutual aid agreement with the City of Hampton.  As a part of this shared service, the agreement will dispatch the closest appropriate Fire/Medical unit to the party in need without regard to city of residence.  Stations for both cities situated along the eight-mile common border will travel between cities as needed.  As a result, the Newport News Fire Department will be able to eliminate 12 positions in time, once the dispatch system and response areas are fully implemented.  For FY 2013, the Department has not eliminated any allotments for any sworn positions in anticipation of the plan coming to successful fruition during the year.  After some time and experience with the new agreement, the Department plans to eliminate the allotments for the 12 firefighter/medic positions in the future.  New Positions in the General Fund Given the financial challenges for FY 2013, the adding of new positions was limited and very specific in nature.  Positions added were generally designed to meet the demands of State-required initiatives, the needs of City Council’s Strategic 8 Priorities, or were public safety related.  Positions were added at minimal expense.  In the Juvenile Services Department a position is being established primarily to prepare policies and procedures and manage the State’s expansive juvenile facility regulations including audits, investigations and the new Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) requirements.  As Customer Service is an important aspect of the City and one of City Council’s Strategic initiatives, the City Manager is recommending the establishment of six new positions to operate the City’s new 311 Customer Service Contact Center.  The 311 operation will be housed in available space in the Peninsula Health District building and will change the way that the City communicates with our customers.  The 311 Contact Center will provide a “one-stop-shop” to answer questions and receive citizen 




3  concerns and issues.  The six positions are offset by reductions of staff support positions in the Engineering and Codes Compliance departments.  A 311 Manager position that was originally established in Information Technology for FY 2012 but not yet filled will be shifted to the new 311 Customer Contact Center department.  These three positions were eliminated from the respective department’s budget for FY 2013 as indicated in Table One below.    Another new position that coincides with this initiative described above is the establishment of a Systems Administrator II in the Information Technology Department.  This position will oversee the system database administration of the City’s 911 communications system and the new 311 Customer Contact Center.  This will further enhance City Council’s Customer Service Strategic initiative.  Another City Council Strategic initiative addressed with a new position is that of Sustainability.  The Department of Public Works will establish a Sustainability Division in the General Fund, including a new Sustainability Manager to oversee the City’s “Green” and sustainability management.  The final department that is being recommended to add General Fund positions is Parks, Recreation and Tourism.  With the completion of the Denbigh Community Center scheduled for the summer of 2012, funding is being established for three, new, full-time positions.  A fourth full-time position for the Community Center was previously established in the department and partially funded for FY 2012, and will be shifted to the Center in FY 2013.  Positions in Other Funds As stated earlier, two positions are being recommended for elimination in Other Funds.  Table Two below details, by department and position, specific changes made to all other funds (other than General Fund) for FY 2013.  There are a total of three new positions being recommended to be added in Other Funds and two additional positions that will be transferred in from the General Fund.  The two positions being transferred from the General Fund are Senior Construction Inspectors, with both moving from the Department of Engineering.  One will transfer to the Stormwater Fund and the other to the Wastewater Fund, which will better reflect proper funding allocation for the work now being performed by these positions.  Two new positions will be established in Stormwater.  An Environmental Inspector and an Environmental Specialist will provide necessary work required by the new and stringent Environmental Protection Agency regulations.  In Wastewater, a new Wastewater Inspector will be established to help oversee and manage the Fats, Oils and Grease (FOG) program mandated by the Department of Environmental Quality’s Regional Consent Order.     




4  Impact

  Even with the addition of a number of positions in support of strategic initiatives or state regulations, the total allotments (positions) in the General Fund are recommended to be reduced from 2,602 to 2,591.  In addition, Attrition Credits will increase in most departments saving additional funds.  Table Three below details Attrition Credits from the Adopted FY 2009 to FY 2013 Recommended Budget.

1 FY 2013 BUDGET POSITION PAPER  APRIL 2012  COMMUNITY SUPPORT FUNDING RECOMMENDATIONS  Overview

  Not-for-profit organizations fill an important role in improving quality of life by providing vital services to residents of Newport News.  The Community Support Action Grant (CSAG) program provides the vehicle for qualified, non-profit organizations to apply for funding from the City for the establishment, expansion or maintenance of community service programs.    Within the Community Support category, the Operating Budget distinguishes between discretionary grant funding for Community Support Agencies and contributions the City makes to support the efforts of Regional Organizations.   For a Community Support Agency to receive a grant award, it must submit an application and meet the following criteria:  The agency must be a not-for-profit, 501 (c)(3) organization meeting the legal requirements of the Commonwealth of Virginia, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and the City of Newport News.    The agency must provide significant, measurable direct services to residents of Newport News.    The agency cannot receive grants from other City resources for the same program for which Community Support funding is requested.  A Regional Organization is one in which the City is either a member of or a participant in. Funding is typically based on either a per capita rate or an existing contractual agreement.  This category includes a broad range of organizations and represents the majority of funding within Community Support.     Issues

  The City Manager has recommended FY 2013 Community Support funding of $8,504,876.  This is an increase of $640,821 over FY 2012.  The funding is comprised of $2,311,252 for Community Support Agencies and $6,193,624 for Regional Organizations.  The categories have increased by $40,000 and $600,821, respectively.   The most 




2 significant increase pertains to Hampton Roads Transit (HRT), a Regional Organization, which is recommended for a $696,230 increase.   FY 2013 funding requested by all Community Support Agencies and Regional Organizations was $9,711,365, representing a $1,847,310 increase over FY 2012, if fully funded.   Funding Strategy

  Community Support The City Manager is recommending that all existing Community Support Agencies be funded at FY 2012 levels, except for the Office of Human Affairs (OHA), which is recommended for a $40,000 increase.      In January 2012, a License and Lease Agreement was arranged between OHA and the City, at City Council’s direction, to formalize the leasing arrangement at four City owned properties in which OHA occupies space.  These Agreements included the requirement that OHA reimburse the City for its share of utilities at these facilities beginning in FY 2013.  The annual utility cost is estimated to be $40,000.  In exchange, the City increased its Community Support funding to OHA by $40,000.  This serves to provide incentive for OHA staff to manage their utility usage consistent with City operations, by allowing OHA to retain any city funding that represents utility savings.  At the same time, OHA will be responsible for any utility costs that are over this additional $40,000 funding, and must reimburse the City in full for those costs.   Five new Community Support Agencies applied for CSAG grant monies, with total new funding of $212,450.  All were considered eligible by the City Attorney’s Office, except for one agency.   The City Manager is recommending that no new agencies receive funding in FY 2013 given the City’s difficult budget environment.  New agencies were not funded in FY 2012.    In addition, during FY 2012, the City Manager suspended the City’s program that allows for eligible agencies to request reimbursement for Real Estate Tax or Personal Property Tax payments made in the preceding fiscal year.    Regional Organizations As noted previously, the majority of Regional Organizations base their annual funding request on either a rate per capita or on a contractual arrangement.  Most of the Regional Organizations partner with the localities in joint efforts for betterment of the Hampton Roads area on several different levels.  As partner agencies, impact of the national recession on the local governments should be readily recognized by the Regional Organizations.  The Hampton Roads Planning District Commission (HRPDC), 




3 recognizing the fiscal stress that its member localities are under, submitted a FY 2013 request that was $6,923 or 3.5% lower than the current year.  No other Regional Agencies voluntarily offered reductions to their FY 2013 request.  Three Regional Organizations are recommended for a 5% reduction in funding:  the Hampton Roads Economic Development Alliance, the Hampton Roads Military and Federal Facilities Alliance, and the Hampton Roads Partnership, for a total reduction of $23,381.     A 2.5% reduction is recommended for Thomas Nelson Community College's capital improvement request, which is a reduction of $5,524 from the FY 2012 funding of $220,962.  However, Thomas Nelson's Workforce Development request is recommended to receive level funding at the current year's amount of $94,247.  The Hampton Roads Sports Commission will not be funded beginning in FY 2013.  This represents a reduction of $27,000.         The General Fund support to Regional Air Service Enhancement Fund (RAISE) is recommended to be reduced by $72,288; this amount will be provided by the Economic Development Authority (EDA) beginning in FY 2013.  RAISE also requested a $313 reduction, which is reflected in the City Manager’s recommended amount.     Hampton Roads Transit (HRT) has requested an FY 2013 increase of $469,000 more than was requested in FY 2012.  This represents a 9.4 percent increase.  In FY 2012, the City funded HRT at $477,000 lower than what HRT had requested.  This was due in part to the City applying a $366,000 FY 2010 credit towards its FY 2012 obligation.  With a higher FY 2013 base amount and no previous year credit to apply to the upcoming year, these factors result in a $946,000 increase from FY 2012 HRT funding levels.  The City Manager is recommending an increase of $696,230, with total HRT funding recommended at $5,200,640.  Also contained within the Community Support funding is a contingency amount of $30,000.  While not specifically designated, this amount is available to fund any eligible agency, based on City Council’s approval.  The Table on the following pages details the FY 2013 CSAG award requests and recommendations, as well as the approved FY 2012 CSAG award amounts.
