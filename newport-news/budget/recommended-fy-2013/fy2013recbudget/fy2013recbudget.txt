REVENUES




      REVENUE ASSUMPTIONS FOR THE FY 2013 ANNUAL OPERATING BUDGET   INTRODUCTION    There are over two hundred revenue items in the General Fund Budget.  This section summarizes the revenue categories and offers insight on the items that are the major producers of City income.   There are many economic and structural factors that determine the amounts of revenue that the City can expect to receive in any fiscal year.  Economic variables that drive many of the revenues include short and long term interest rates, employment, personal income, consumer confidence, retail sales, housing demands, and most notably over the past few years, fuel prices.  Structural determinants include policies and formulas developed by the State to distribute educational, social service, and other funds as well as regulations it places on the establishment and administration of local taxes and fees.    This is all true for a “normal” fiscal year budget development process.  Over the past six fiscal years, the national economy could hardly be described as normal.  The extraordinary strength of the national and local housing markets that ramped up to late 2008 was reflected in the rapid rise in housing values and the attendant increase in single family real estate assessment revenue. This trend began to moderate in FY 2009, and the national recession hit hard and quickly in September 2008, with the sub-prime housing market failure, and other ensuing connected fiscal associations.  Deep expenditure reductions were made in FY 2009, to ensure that the City ended the fiscal year in a positive status, based on projected revenue shortfalls of almost $13 million in the General Fund.  Based on the cuts made in FY 2009, FY 2010 revenues were projected on a deepening recession; further revenue was lost from the impact of job losses, and home foreclosures.  The FY 2011 revenue forecast was equally harsh, exhibiting for the first time the full impact on local revenues from the continuing failing housing market.  The trend continued in FY 2012.  For fiscal years 2009 to 2012, the real estate levy dropped from $15.274 billion to $14.727 billion, or a loss of $547 million or 3.6% in the value of the levy.  This resulted in a net loss of revenue current Real Estate Taxes as the General Fund’s largest single cash source of $6 million.   Several factors were considered as part of the revenue projections for the upcoming fiscal year.  The base assumption is that the recession will mitigate during FY 2012, and will show some moderate recovery in select areas of 

FY 2013 Recommended Budget - Page 17




      the local economy, but that the housing market would still remain at a low point.  Due to the lag time in real estate reassessments, the revenue impact is felt by the City after the actual property sales have occurred.   Real Estate Tax revenues will show a marked decline from the current year.  FY 2013 indicates that while there are some increases and decreases in residential assessments, the average residential assessment will decrease by an additional 7% over the current year.  For commercial properties, this real estate assessment decline will be lower, at around 1%, with condominiums showing the greatest assessment change of an average of 11% decline in value.  This results in current real estate tax revenue loss of $7.2 million for FY 2013.   This continued loss of current real estate taxes serves to reinforce the decision that was made by City Council as part of the FY 2012 Operating Budget to move Real Estate Tax abatement and deferral to deferral only.  The major factor behind this program shift is that the Elderly and Disabled Tax Exemption Program by its very nature have changed exponentially from what was originally intended.  Support for the tax abatement program is now five times more expensive than it was 20 years ago, and with forecasts that Newport News’ elderly will make up approximately 40 percent of the City’s total population by the year 2030.  This number will certainly continue to rise.  In FY 2012, tax relief represents close to $3 million loss in revenue to the City.  This amount does not include the impact of the recently enacted tax relief for Disabled Veterans, which took effect on July 1, 2012.  Projections are that given the same course of use by the eligible elderly of the tax abatement program, the City would lose substantial additional Real Estate Tax revenue just within the next five years, at the same time that all localities are incurring signification loss of income from this source in the ongoing national recession.  In order to cover the gap in revenue created by this program, the City would need to increase the real estate tax rate for all other property owners, an option that is not equitable to the City’s residents as a whole.  It must be recognized as well, that the elderly citizenry, both taxpaying and those in the abatement/deferral program, routinely use City services, for which there must be a way to support those services.  While it is always hard to make a decision that negatively affects any members of the City’s population, it was concluded that it would not be financially responsible to continue a program that could not be sustained.    The City Manager made this difficult recommendation.  As with any change to service for citizens, it was a decision adopted by City Council only after much deliberation on the impact of the current program participants.  This program shift was advocated by a citizen-populated Operational Efficiency Committee for the City.  One of the critical elements of the program is that there was a lag of two years before the effective date of the tax deferral program, allowing sufficient time for all parties to make the important decisions on their future finances, after due consideration and advice.  Both the City Manager and the City Council wanted to ensure sufficient preparation time for this transition, in relationship to each current participant’s situation.  

FY 2013 Recommended Budget - Page 18




       One important element is often overlooked when discussing this program:  there is no cash impact on a current tax abatement participant as they move to tax deferral.  The individual continues to be the immediate beneficiary of not having to pay current real estate taxes.  The tax responsibility is shifted to the estate of the individual, and is collected only at the sale of the property or transfer of the property’s title.  As an indication of the impact of the program, Tax Relief dropped from $2.8 million to $2.2 million in FY 2013, with 68 fewer applicants than in the current fiscal year.   Likewise, strong consumer retrenchment during the initial recession resulted in decreased yields from sales, meals, and lodging taxes and other retail oriented taxes.  In the past, this particular group of locally sensitive consumer revenues provided the City with the ability to weather economic downturns and unexpected financial obligations.  At the onset of current economic downturn there was significant negative effect on these revenue sources.  While the City has been in the preservation mode for the recent and past fiscal years, most revenue sources are showing signs of growth that are consistent with the performance of the current fiscal year, indicating a slow but steady recovery.  If these modest increases in these locally generated taxes continue, the initially projected revenue could be better than estimated for the upcoming fiscal year.    State reimbursement for several programs continues to be a deep source of revenue reductions for the sixth consecutive year.  State aid to localities for Human/Social Service programs, HB-599 Public Safety funding and State Compensation Board reimbursements for the Constitutional Officers has been further reduced over this time period, both during the fiscal year and again with each new state budget adoption.  For the most part, while the State recognizes it obligation to reimburse localities for State responsible functions, it does not provide the necessary funding nor reduce the service requirements. In addition, the State has withheld locally generated taxes as a revenue stream for the state, when the state code indicates otherwise. These reductions, coupled with declining local revenues have forced the City to make expenditure reductions which will impact service delivery to its citizenry.   The Department of Budget Department and Evaluation employs several techniques to forecast the amount of money a particular revenue source is likely to generate over the course of the fiscal year.  These include:   Historical trends over time - usually over no more than 18-24 months  Analysis of previous years’ property tax delinquency patterns  State and Federal notification of amounts that are provided for particular programs  Projections of “usage” of a particular service that is fee-generating over the twelve-month budget period

GENERAL PROPERTY TAXES

The overall General Property Taxes revenue category is estimated to decrease by ($2,434,510), or (1.1%) in FY 2013. Current Real Estate Tax revenue comprises 69.6% of the revenue in this category.  It is estimated to decrease by $7,273,537, or 4.6%.  This decrease is due to the third consecutive fiscal year of declining real estate assessed valuations.  Residential properties are estimated to decline by an average of 7.3%, with most commercial properties experiencing a smaller decrease of less than one percent decrease.  The Real Estate Tax Rate is recommended to remain at $1.10, as it has been since FY 2008.  Real Estate Tax Delinquencies estimated revenue are expected to grow to $4 million in total.  Based on current year actual and revisions to City policy in FY 2012, Real Estate Tax Deferral (also known as Tax Relief) is expected to decrease from $2.8 million to $2.2 million, or (21%) in the upcoming fiscal year.  This is a result of lower assessment values in general and fewer applicants participating in the  program.  Beginning in FY 2012, based on a State constitutional amendment change, 100% Real Estate Tax Relief is permitted for Disabled Veterans.  The estimated cost

, 100% Real Estate Tax Relief is permitted for Disabled Veterans.  The estimated cost of this program is again budgeted at $475,000, level with the current fiscal year.    The collections from  Personal Property taxes are estimated to rise by nearly $2 million, based on the increased value of the levy.  It is recommended that the Personal Property Taxes rate be increased from the current level of $4.25 to $4.50.  This increase in the rate will generate an estimated $2.4 million during FY 2013.  Delinquent Personal Property Tax collections will decrease by $450,000 to $3.05 million.  The tax levy associated with Personal Property Taxes continues to recover as consumers replace older vehicles with newer models.The Machinery and Tools Taxes are estimated to increase by nearly $497,000, or 3% to $16.8 million in FY 2013 due to expansion of select industries in the City.   The General Property Tax revenue category comprises 54% of all revenue received by the General Fund during the fiscal year.

The revenues collected in the Other Local Taxes category reflects economic activity and fluctuates with changes in economic conditions.  These revenues have been some of the most sensitive to the recession.  Activity in each element is an indication of the impact of the enduring financial situation and individual responses to that condition.  For many of these revenue sources, projections are consistent with FY 2012 projected collections.  However, due primarily to revenue declines in the General Property Taxes category, certain tax rates in this category are being recommended to increase.  Cigarette Taxes are recommended to increase from $0.75 per pack of 20 to $0.85.  This is anticipated to generate approximately $700,000 in additional revenue.  Meals Tax is recommended to increase from 6.5% to 7.5%.  Coupled with higher collections, this 1% rate increase is anticipated to result in $2,706,435 more in revenue from this source.  Finally, the Electric Utility Consumer Taxisrecommended to have the $80.00 per month cap removed for Industrial Users only on the per month tax payment.  The tax rate will remain the same as in current year and the commercial and residential caps will remain in place.FY 2012 Revised EstimateFY 2013 EstimateVariancePercentSales Tax$21,100,000$21,500,000$400,0001.9%BPOL Tax14,285,00015,285,0001,000,0007.0%Telecommunications Tax12,300,00012,000,000(300,000)(2.4%)Other Utilities Tax7,418,9168,304,224885,30811.9%Motor Vehicle License3,930,0003,940,00010,0000.3%Cigarette Tax4,600,0005,400,000800,00017.4%Lodging Tax2,980,0383,100,000119,9624.0%Meal Tax17,591,83120,406,4352,814,60416.0%Amusement Tax478,000478,00000.0%All Other Local Tax Revenue3,156,500

This revenue category is highlysensitive to the economic climate.  While residential singlefamily home construction is slow to recover, apartment and condominium constructions have improved.  Building Permit and Engineering Fees are at lower levels than prior fiscal years.  Commercial construction continues to improve over recent years, as several large construction projects throughout the City are under way.  However, the scale of these types of projects cannot be anticipatedin the future.  The figures below reflect the positive upswing in commercial buildings.  A new revenue source in this category is the Special Event/Parade Fee.  Adopted in FY 2012, this revenue is generated by a $50 application fee per event, with $5,000 in new revenue from this source.

Fines and Forfeitures revenue consists offunds received for various court fines and fees, parking fines, the courthouse maintenance fee, and other miscellaneous fines.   The FY 2013 Recommended Budget of $2,838,551 reflects an increase of $614,551, or 27.6%.  This increase is comprised primarily in two areas.  In FY 2012, Photo Red was operational for the first time at all three locations within the City for all approaches.  Although the intent of the program is to deter red light infractions, prevent major accidents, and encourage safe driving, it is generating more revenue than anticipated for the current fiscal year.The Court Fees & Fines have also been increased to reflect a more accurate budget estimate of traffic court revenue being collected.

This category is primarily composed of revenue sources from interest earned on bank deposits, participation fees charged for City-sponsored recreational activities ($537,453), the Health Building Rent ($523,120), and rent at the Seafood Industrial Park ($461,946).  Approximately 12% of the revenue in this category is interest earned on cash balances of City funds.  With interest earnings at a national low, it is anticipated that very little revenue will be generated by this sourceinFY 2013, and shows the largest reduction from the FY 2012 estimate.   Participant Fees for soccer, football and basketball are estimated to generate $94,585 in revenue for FY 2013, which will help to offset officiating costs for each event; however theestimates represent a decrease of over ($30,000) from FY 2012 due to decreased participation levels.  Additionally, revenue received from Radio Tower Rents are estimated to decrease by ($21,353), and  Police and Commissioner of the Revenue copier fees are estimated to decrease ($3,700).FY 2012 Revised EstimateFY 2013 EstimateVariancePercentInterest-Bank Deposits$400,000$275,000($125,000)(31.3%)City Parks/Recreation Activities576,723537,453(39,270)(6.8%)Health Building Rent523,120523,12000.0%Seafood Industrial Park Rent413,811461,94648,13511.6%Radio Tower Rents152,314130,961(21,353)(14.0%)Downtown Engineering Bldg Rent106,119106,11900.0%Copier Fee45,00041,300(3,700)(8.2%)All Other Use of Money Revenues209,989

The Charges for Services revenue category is expected to increase by $518,111. The revenues in this category consist of specific userfees charges. Two major revenue sources that generate 82%, or $5,297,656 of this category are Clerk of Court Fees and EMS Fees.  ForFY 2013, Clerk of Court Fees, which have historically proven to be stable regardless of economic conditions, remained unchanged from FY 2012 at$1,100,000.  Due to the Mutual Aid Agreement with the City of Hampton, a revised fee structure was established, which is proposed to increase the EMS Fees by $507,656, or 13.8% over FY 2012.

Theincrease in the Miscellaneous Revenue category is primarily due to additional revenue of $512,189 for Street Highway Maintenance reimbursement from the State (the State reimburses the City for certain street repairs and maintenance).  Partially offsetting this increase is a change in the way that revenue from the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) is collected.  In the current year, General Fund revenue of $155,000 is shown.  After consideration on how these administrative fees are accounted for back to VDOT on a project-by-project basis, it will be more appropriate to show the revenue as a reimbursement in the Engineering Department where the actual administrative costs are managed.  CDBG funds for the sidewalk extension program will not be collected as the backlog of projects have been completed.FY 2012 Revised EstimateFY 2013 EstimateVariancePercentStreet Highway Maintenance Fee$14,193,565$14,705,754$512,1893.6%Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILT)12,285,8762,295,1699,2930.4%Rebate/P-Card Transactions98,00098,00000.0%City Farm Canteen Fund68,39368,8194260.6%All Other Miscellaneous Revenue569,746

Recovered Costs are revenue reimbursements for local government expenditures for services provided on behalf of the State and for services provided to other entities.  This Categoryreflects increased revenue of $378,821, or 4%.  Some revenues in the category have been reduced in response to State budget cuts made over the last few years.  For example, the City Jail Reimbursements have been reduced by ($88,499) to more accurately reflect the reduced revenue from recent year State cuts in the inmate per diem payments.  Increased revenue of $332,429 is anticipated from higher Information Technology Charges associated with use by for Human Services.  Indirect Costs paid to the General Fund by other funds for Stormwater and Recreation Funds have also increased by $83,140.  Finally, the Office of Human Affairs will begin reimbursing the City in FY 2013 for its share of utility usage at the facilities in which it occupies space according to the license agreement adopted in FY 2012.  This new revenue is estimated to be $40,000, and is offset by an increase in Community Support amount.

As with other types of State reimbursement to the City for State functions, the Commonwealth of Virginia Biennial Budget for FY 2013 -FY 2014 reflects reductions for most revenue sources for Constitutional Officer operations; yet, the service level requirements by the State have not been reduced, thereby requiring theCity to absorb an increasinglylarger percent of the cost of operations for State functions.The following table shows the estimated reimbursements along with the FY 2013 Recommended Budget amount for each Constitutional Officer and the Voter Registrar/Electoral Board.  The City's cost for each is shown as well.  The FY 2013

Categorical Aid revenues are comprised of pass-through funds from the Federal government and the Commonwealth of Virginia and designated for specific purposes.  The majority of these monies are reimbursement for services provided by the Department of Human Services.  In FY 2013, the Recommended Budget reflects a ($6,069,870) reduction, or (16%).   Although State funding has been reduced in recent years, the primary cause of this reduction in FY 2013 is the State assumingthe administration of child care payments to vendors, as of January 2012.  The annual child care revenue was estimated at $5,130,000 in FY 2012 and has been completely eliminated in FY 2013.  The corresponding child care costs of $6,962,013 have also been reduced from the Human Services budget.  Other reductions were made with adoption and foster care reimbursements to more accurately reflect recent activity.  For FY 2013, the State is no longer treating the Emergency Management account as a direct revenue, rather it will be treated as a grant.  The Fire department will apply for the grant and show appropriate expenses for reimbursement.  Also, State Aid to Libraries will be reduced for the sixth consecutive year.FY 2012 Revised EstimateFY 2013 EstimateVariancePercentHuman Services$29,378,664$23,399,170($5,979,494)(20.4%)Law Enforcement (HB599)8,263,9178,254,927(8,990)(0.1%)Emergency Management52,4000(52,400)(100.0%)State Aid to Libraries158,628157,392(1,236)(0.8%)EMS Funds/License Tax118,750

The Non-Revenue Receipts category is comprised of two revenue sources for FY 2013.  The first is the Return on Investment from the Public Utilities Fund, which is recommended to remain level at $9,891,000.  This is the second year of a three year repayment plan (or reduction from $10,000,000) to refund the Public Utilities Fund for the purchase of land associated with a potential road project.  The second revenue source is Payment from Wastewater -Consent Order.   In FY 2008, the General Fund loaned $3,500,000 to the Wastewater Fund to begin work on the Federally mandated Regional Consent Order to identify and fix wastewater system issues.  In FY 2011, the Wastewater Fund began repaying the General Fund for the loan provided.  FY 2013 represents year three of a five-year repayment plan.  Total FY 2013 reimbursement is $750,000.The decrease of ($101,520) in this category is due to City Council approval of the use of one-time reserve funding in FY 2012 for two sewer projects:   Sanitary Pump Station No. 26 ($33,000) and Turtle Creek Pump Station Participation Project ($68,520).

The Payment from Other Funds category represents revenue from other funds to the General Fund.  The sole remaining revenuein this category is the payment from the Applied Research Center (ARC).  This revenue is used to offset part of the debt service on the Applied Research Center project.  The amount has decreased by (2.9%) in FY 2013 due to the debt being refinanced at a lower interest rate.

EXPENDITURES




FY 2013 RECOMMENDED OPERATING BUDGET SUMMARY OF EXPENDITURES               The General Fund is the principal fund of the City, accounting for most of the primary services associated with local government.  These basic services include public safety, public works, health and welfare, parks, recreation and culture, and the general administration of the City.  The General Fund also makes significant funding contributions to the Public Education Fund, and is required to pay School debt through payments to the Debt Service Fund.  A brief explanation of General Fund expenditures by category follows.  Other major operating funds that are significant elements of the FY 2013 Operating Budget (Schools, Public Works User Funds, Public Utilities, and Parks and Recreation funds) are presented after the General Fund summary.   Of the $414.2 million proposed budget for Fiscal Year 2013, nearly $358.8 million, or 86.6%, is dedicated to eight functions.  The largest components of the Recommended FY 2013 General Fund Budget are funding for School Operations and School Debt Service ($113.4 million, or 27.4% of total General Fund expenditures) and Public Safety (Police and Fire, which includes Emergency Management - $67.1 million, 16.2%).  Other significant components are Non-departmental ($41.9 million, 10.1%), Health and Welfare programs ($35.2 million, 8.5%), City Debt Service ($35.0 million, 8.4%), which includes General Obligation Bonds and support for airport debt service, Corrections and Detention (Sheriff, City Farm, Juvenile Services - $28.2 million; 6.8%), Parks, Cultural, and Development ($19.8 million, 4.8%) and Public Works ($18.2 million, 4.4%).        The Table below FY 2013 General Fund Recommended Operating Budget - Departmental Summary presents a comparison of fiscal year FY 2011 actual spending, the FY 2012 budget and the FY 2013 City Manager Recommended Budget.  The Summary also shows the expenses that would exist by department if all retirement costs (City Pension Fund costs and VRS obligations) were still located in the departments (see paragraph at the start of the Table below).  Expenditures are detailed by budget category and individual departments.  Following the Table are brief narratives that describe departmental changes for FY 2013.

FY 2013 Recommended Budget - Page 42




FY 2013 Recommended Budget - General Fund, Continued     The FY 2013 Recommended Budget reflects the third consecutive year of falling real estate assessments and stymied economic recovery due to the long national recession.  This dynamic has created another difficult budget year, in which operating expenses had to be cut, reduced, or eliminated in the face of continued State revenue cuts and declining real estate tax base.  While there appears to be consistent activity in the most economically sensitive local revenues that impact citizens directly (Sales, Meals, and Lodging Taxes), a modest growth in Machinery and Tools and Personal Property Taxes Revenues are projected for FY 2013.     During the preparation of the Recommended Budget, each department gave a thorough evaluation of its operations to identify opportunities to reduce costs.  Core functions were focused on, with the direction to ensure the greatest efficiencies at the lowest possible cost.  The result of this effort includes program and service reductions, and some eliminations that will have impact on citizens.    Increases have been budgeted for the cost of health insurance, vehicle and equipment fuel costs, and a salary adjustment.  Again in FY 2013, a substantial increase has been budgeted for the City’s contribution to the Pension Fund, as the fourth year of an eight-year plan to continue progress toward meeting the Annual Required Contribution (ARC).   The contribution will increase from 59% to 65% of the ARC in FY 2013.   Key funding issues for FY 2013 include:      City Support to Schools had been increased from the FY 2012 amount of $112,200,000 to $113,400,000. This represents an increase of $1,200,000, or 1.1%.  This amount includes $12,102,712 in School Fund Debt Service paid by the General Fund.  As part of the Schools support, the General Fund will continue to provide $600,000 of Schools grounds maintenance funds and $2,409,570 for Information Technology support.   

FY 2013 Recommended Budget - Page 43




FY 2013 Recommended Budget - General Fund, Continued     The FY 2013 Recommended Budget includes the net elimination of eleven full-time General Fund positions. Twelve new positions were added for FY 2013.  The majority of the new positions are in the new Denbigh Community Center (3) and the new Customer Service – 311 Call Center (6).  Of the six positions being added to the new Customer Service – 311 Call Center, three are being shifted from other Departments as follows:  Information Technology (1), Codes Compliance (1), and Engineering (1).   Additionally, existing Attrition Credit amounts were increased in several departments (an Attrition Credit reduces a Department’s budget for salaries and fringe benefits based on an anticipated lag time between an employee termination and when a new employee is hired).   General Fund support for the City’s Debt Service will be $34,630,325.  This figure includes payments for outstanding General Obligation Debt and Airport Debt Service of $544,204.  The Recommended Budget assumes a General Obligation bond issuance during FY 2013, and has $330,000 budgeted for in anticipation of bond issue costs.     Cash Capital, a component of the City’s adopted Capital Financing and Debt Management Policies, is budgeted at $2,894,246.  It is the intention to use funds from the Special Projects Fund to increase the cash capital funding to meet the required debt service policy.  Cash Capital allows for current operating funds to be used to fund lesser expensive and more regular capital investments (e.g., roof and HVAC replacements, and capital equipment) to decrease reliance on bond cash for shorter term capital projects.   A 1.5% salary adjustment (effective January 1, 2013) has been budgeted for FY 2013.  This cost is budgeted at $1.0 million in the Nondepartmental cost center of the General Fund, and subsequently in each Special Revenue and Trust Fund.  In addition, $500,000 is budgeted for targeted adjustments recommended in the compensation study.    Health Insurance premium rates for FY 2013 are anticipated to increase 5% effective December 2012.  The resulting impact to the General Fund is a health care cost increase of $1.5 million and retains the 75% employer/25% employee ratio on the full cost of the individual premiums.  

FY 2013 Recommended Budget - Page 44




  FY 2013 Recommended Budget - General Fund, Continued    In FY 2010, the City began efforts to meet the goal of funding 100% of the actuarially determined Annual Required Contribution (ARC) to the Pension Fund in eight years.  The phased plan is continued in the Recommended Budget, with retirement contributions at 65% of the ARC.  In an effort to increase transparency, improve year to year comparisons and for better fiscal control, retirement contributions have been removed from individual departments and placed in one location (Nondepartmental).   This includes all costs for both City and VRS retirement obligations.  Total contributions for the Newport News Employees Retirement Fund and Other Post Employment Benefits are $30,317,810 combined.  The Recommended Budget reflects approved changes to the City’s retirement plan that were adopted on March 1, 2010, and calculates retirement benefits for newly hired employees after this date at the Virginia Retirement System (VRS) rate.   Fuel prices continue to trend higher for FY 2012.  The FY 2013 Recommended Budget assumes an average fuel purchase price of $3.55 cents per gallon, which is a 1.4% increase to the FY 2012 budgeted per gallon rate.  The resulting FY 2013 impact to the General Fund is a fuel cost increase of $148,612.

FY 2013 General Fund Recommended Operating BudgetDepartmental SummaryRetirement Costs Included

In FY 2013, a significant change occurred in the representation of Retirement costs for City employees.  The annual pension cost is a fundamental expense, whether through the City’s independent pension program or through participation in the Virginia Retirement System (VRS).  For that reason, all costs associated with retirement have been moved from the individual departments of the General Fund and consolidated in the Nondepartmental cost center.  (Retirement expense funding for all Special Revenue and Trust Funds remains in those Funds.)  This shift of expense allows for increased transparency as to the total cost of retirement expenses, an easier year-to-year-comparison moving forward, and better fiscal control.For this reason, the annual comparison of year-to-year activity between FY 2011, FY 2012, and FY 2013 is problematic.  Inthe Table below, the values for FY 2013 are shown adjusted for retirement costs removed from the Department.  The far column to the right of the page shows FY 2013 as if it included retirement costs, as in FY 2011 Actual and FY 2012 Revisedcolumns.

FY 2013 Recommended Budget - Page 49




 FY 2013 Recommended Budget – General Fund, Continued  The notes below provide brief explanation of expenditure adjustments incorporated into the FY 2013 Recommended Operating Budget.   The following narratives do not address universal adjustments made to individual operating departments for the various insurances (Health, Dental, Worker’s Compensation, General Liability and Auto), Vehicle Repairs, Replacements, and Fuel.  Additionally, in an effort to increase transparency, improve year to year comparisons, and for better fiscal control, Newport News Employees Retirement Fund and Other Post Employment Benefits (OPEB) contributions have been moved from individual departments and placed in one location (the Nondepartmental cost center of the General Fund).  To equalize the comparison, all departmental expenses associated with employees in the Virginia Retirement System (VRS) (VRS Retirement, Health Reimbursement Account, and VRS Group Life) are shown in the Nondepartmental cost center as well.  This consolidates into one place the total value of all current year retirement obligations for the General Fund, regardless of the plan that the individual employee falls under.  The expenditure changes discussed below that compare current fiscal year (FY 2012) expenditures to the FY 2013 proposed budget do not include the values of departmental reduction of the retirement funds, City Retirement or VRS costs.  City Council 

- Various operational expense line items were reduced totaling ($4,100).  These include Repairs, City Gifts, Printing, Postage, Freight Charges, Supplies, Travel, and Meeting Expenses.   City Clerk

 - Various operational expense line items were reduced a total of ($2,478).  These include Repairs, Advertising, Records Storage, Printing, City Code Supplements, Dues and Associated Memberships, and Travel.   City Manager

 - Various operational expense line items were reduced totaling ($7,350).  These include Overtime, Repairs, Printing, Postage, Office Supplies, Telecommunications, Books, and Mileage Reimbursement.  In the Video Productions cost center, ($53,737) in savings was generated by reductions in various areas that include Freight costs, Other Professional Services, Advertising, and 

FY 2013 Recommended Budget - Page 50




 FY 2013 Recommended Budget – General Fund, Continued  Postage.  The largest change was shifting $44,000 of cost for maintaining the technical equipment (cameras, editing boards, sound equipment, etc.) of Video Productions from the General Fund to the revenue received from by the public equipment grant fees generated by the City’s Cable Franchise agreements with the two local providers.  Such equipment maintenance is allowed by these agreements.  Total departmental reductions are ($61,087).    Human Resources

 – The remainder of funding for Part Time staffing was eliminated ($12,427), Advertising was reduced due the hiring freeze and projected job market ($2,000), and Travel/Training-Meeting Expense funding was reduced ($2,000) as more Internet research and training is being performed by Human Resources staff.  In addition, one (1) vacant Human Resources Specialist was eliminated.   City Attorney

 - The City Attorney’s Office provides legal services to the Department of Human Services for various social services related cases and activities.  These services are billed out of the City Attorney’s Office to the Department of Human Services as a credit, Work Performed for Others.  The Department of Human Services maintains that expense, and in turn is able to request reimbursement from the State for those costs.  There continues to be a declining number of hours spent on the Human Services caseload.  A reduction of ($125,000) in these recoverable fees aligns the cost with actual expense history.  This results in an overall increase to the Department’s budget.  However, there is a corresponding decrease in the Human Services Department in Contractual Services for these same services.  In addition, ($11,797) in various operating expense reductions occurred, plus an additional ($27,490) in attrition savings is recognized in the FY 2013 Recommended Budget, for a total departmental reduction of ($39,287) in expenses not associated with the Human Services departmental support.

 FY 2013 Recommended Budget – General Fund, Continued  

Commissioner of Revenue

 –  The decrease is attributed to reductions that were made to Postage in 

the State Income Tax and Business & Professional License Tax Divisions totaling ($3,000), as well as 

reductions that were made to Other Supplies in the State Income Tax and Related Tax Divisions totaling 

($3,037).  In addition, reductions to funding for Overtime and Temporary were made to more closely align 

the budget with projected expense levels for a reduction of ($23,695).    City Treasurer

 - The decrease is primarily attributed to reductions made to Temporary and Overtime funding to more properly align budgeted levels with projected expense levels for a reduction of ($9,198).     Finance

 – Although no positions were eliminated, a savings of ($40,000) was obtained by freezing a vacated position.  The new Director of Finance was recently hired and plans to critically review the Department’s staffing needs and organizational structure.     Budget and Evaluation

 – The decrease reflects attrition savings of ($50,364) associated with retirement of the Budget Manager and the vacancy of a Senior Budget Analyst position within the Department.   Purchasing

 – Funding for operational expenses such as Repairs, Contractual Services, Virginia Power, Supplies and Books was reduced by a total of ($9,617), and funding for the Temporary position in the Administration Division was eliminated ($18,253).  In addition, $9,564 was added to the Mail Room Division to support the rental costs of a new mail machine and meter necessary due to the postage increase incurred in January 2012.  Funding was increased by $25,000 in the Warehouse – Work Performed for Others account to align the budgeted levels with actual and historical expenses.  

FY 2013 Recommended Budget - Page 52




 FY 2013 Recommended Budget – General Fund, Continued  Information Technology

 – The Department’s recommended budget includes savings of ($377,000).  The Department will freeze the Web Development Manager position vacated in late FY 2012 through retirement for attrition savings of ($127,000).  Additionally, Part Time labor expenses are being reduced by ($71,000) and the functions provided by this position will be absorbed by the departmental employees.  Offsetting this, a newly created Systems Administrator II position is recommended to manage the new technologies and upgraded communication systems within the 911 Center and the upcoming 311 Customer Service Center.  The net impact of all personnel actions is a budget savings of ($112,000).  New technologies are being used to reduce costs and save money, where appropriate.  Contracts have been rebid saving significant dollars.  For example, the Department switched telephone land line providers resulting in cost reductions of approximately ($187,000) City-wide, with no operating impact on the service provided.  Various operating expenses totaling ($82,000) are recommended for reduction to more accurately reflect historical usage and departmental efficiencies.        General Registrar

 – The decrease is associated with changes in employee-selected Group Health and Dental coverages.  In addition, funding was added to the Nondepartmental-Contingencies section of the budget to support the Presidential Election in November 2012.  This amount is equal to the costs association with 2008 Presidential Election.  This funding, which totals $122,778, will support additional staffing and overtime expenses ($45,000), Election Officials to assist with election preparations ($38,000), printing for voter ballots, election forms and training manuals ($18,500), postage for absentee ballot mailings ($7,000), and supplies ($14,278).        Judiciary 

- Various operational expense line items in the General District Court Civil, Criminal, Additional and Traffic Divisions, Juvenile Domestic Relations Court and The Office of the Magistrate were reduced totaling ($16,360).  One (1) vacant Deputy Clerk I position was eliminated in the Circuit Court Clerk’s Office ($39,204).   In addition, the Circuit Court Clerk’s Office reduced funding in various operational line 

FY 2013 Recommended Budget - Page 53




 FY 2013 Recommended Budget – General Fund, Continued  items (Jury/Commissioner Fees, Printing, and Microfilm Supplies) totaling ($20,750), for a total departmental reduction of ($59,954).     Commonwealth's Attorney

 - Part-time funding has been decreased by ($15,000) due to attrition savings associated with the retirement of a long-term Commonwealth Attorney Investigator position.  In addition, the Attrition Credit for this Department was increased by $3,000 from $70,000 to $73,000 (an Attrition Credit reduces a Department’s budget for salaries and fringe benefits based on an anticipated lag time between an employee termination and when a new employee is hired).     Police

 – For FY 2013, Overtime funding has been decreased by ($200,000).  An increase of $300,000 to the Attrition Credit has been added to the Department, to offset any additional expenses (an Attrition Credit reduces a Department’s budget for salaries and fringe benefits based on an anticipated lag time between an employee termination and when a new employee is hired).  The total departmental Attrition Credit is now $1,300,000 for FY 2013.   Fire

 - The Department will eliminate one (1) Payroll Technician position ($47,281); one (1) Administrative Assistant position ($48,159); and one (1) Assistant Fire Marshall II position ($56,609) for a total full time position savings of ($152,049).  The Department is in collaboration with the City of Hampton on two shared service programs.  These two (2) areas of shared service programs are being utilized for savings in both localities in FY 2013. One is the Consolidation of Logistic Functions whereby combining the warehouse functions and personnel of both cities into one site will create efficiencies, reduce personnel, and create savings through bulk purchases.  Savings here represents the elimination of one (1) full-time Firefighter position ($58,280) and bulk purchase savings of ($23,000).  The other is the Automatic Mutual Aid between Fire Departments along the 8-mile common border to allow the closest, most appropriate unit response for calls to the public.  Three stations in both cities mirror each other along the City line.  

FY 2013 Recommended Budget - Page 54




 FY 2013 Recommended Budget – General Fund, Continued  Once implemented, the mutual aid response time will be reduced for both cities, and overtime this could result in the elimination of twelve (12) Firefighter positions ($699,362).  For FY 2013, all positions are funded to phase in programs to the best advantage of both localities.  Combined, both initiatives could eventually generate savings of ($780,642).  The Department decreased its Attrition Credit by $425,000 to the level of vacancies (an Attrition Credit reduces a Department’s budget for salaries and fringe benefits based on an anticipated lag time between an employee termination and when a new employee is hired).  Funding has been added for the addition of one (1) new Staff Technician position ($49,937), and supplemental pay of $1,500 each for twelve (12) Fire Inspection Specialists positions ($48,159) who will provide fire inspection services in lieu of the Fire Marshall’s position.  Funding for these positions will be offset by the reduction of the Payroll Technician, Administrative Assistant, and the Assistant Fire Marshall II positions.     Sheriff

 – In FY 2013, the Department is recommended to have higher Regional Jail and inmate medical care expenses.  The City’s agreement is to house a minimum of 200 inmates at the Regional Jail each day.  In FY 2013, the daily inmate fees will increase $4 per day from $45 per day to $49.  This increased cost is due to State reductions to the Regional Jail, and reduced dependence on the rate stabilization funds of the Regional Jail.  Overall FY 2013 Regional Jail costs are recommended to increase by $133,400.  Historically, the City houses an average of between 200 and 220 inmates per day; the Sheriff will be attempting to reduce that average to 200 daily to keep Regional Jail costs to a minimum.        Beginning in FY 2012, the Sheriff entered into a new service contract with Conmed Healthcare Management to provide inmate medical and psychiatric care.  By using contracted physician and nursing services, there is better direct care due to a consistent workforce, and extended services for mental health.  The result is Overtime savings for Deputies for medical transportation of inmates of ($20,000) and a reduction of Part Time Nurse funds for the clinic of ($32,000).  Additionally, the food vendor contract has been rebid.  In FY 2013, overall contractual services will increase by $170,000.  In addition, budget savings of ($15,000) are recommended in machinery and equipment purchases and utility costs 

FY 2013 Recommended Budget - Page 55




 FY 2013 Recommended Budget – General Fund, Continued  were reduced by ($15,000).  The Attrition Credit has increased by ($165,000) to ($344,200) (an Attrition Credit reduces a Department’s budget for salaries and fringe benefits based on an anticipated lag time between an employee termination and when a new employee is hired).     Adult Corrections

 – In effort to provide departmental savings, the Department will eliminate one (1) vacant Equipment Operator A position ($38,489).  Part-time funding of $18,000 was added to offset the elimination of the full-time position and enhance community maintenance initiatives.   Juvenile Services

 - The Department continues to reorganize positions to more efficiently and effectively operate.  Part of the reorganization focuses on a new Medical Service Contract for Secure Detention ($386,580).  This new Medical Service Contract will enhance the services and reduce the liability to the City.  The funding for this contract would come from the elimination of two (2) Registered Nurse positions ($144,644), and one (1) Licensed Practical Nurse position ($51,499), and the elimination of the current Medical Service Contract ($47,875) (found in the Nondepartmental-Contingencies division of the General Fund under the Nondepartmental Tab of this book).  Reductions in Medical & Lab supplies, Prescriptions, Professional Health services and other healthcare related items ($114,613) complete these savings.  Other reductions include one (1) Laundry Worker position ($31,738), one (1) Storekeeper position ($44,739), one (1) Senior Custodian position ($33,729), Part-time funding ($169,845), and other operating expenses ($228,863).  Funding has been added to the Juvenile Services budget for a Human Resource Manager position which will be offset by the reduction of the above positions.  In addition, the Attrition Credit for this Department was increased by $20,000 from $271,956 to $291,956 (an Attrition Credit reduces a Department’s budget for salaries and fringe benefits based on an anticipated lag time between an employee termination and when a new employee is hired).        

FY 2013 Recommended Budget - Page 56




 FY 2013 Recommended Budget – General Fund, Continued  Codes Compliance

 – One (1) vacant Administrative Assistant II position is being reallocated to the new Customer Service - 311 Call Center.  This is expected to reduce the Department’s budget by $31,000 however, does not reduce the General Fund’s total budget.  Savings of various operating line items totaling ($4,000) are also recommended.  Synergies between Codes Compliance and the new Customer Service – 311Call Center becomes operational, as a significant number of citizen calls are Codes Compliance related.   Engineering

 – The FY 2013 recommended budget includes over ($375,000) in reductions.   These reductions include savings to the General Fund from the transfer of one Sr. Construction Inspector to the Stormwater Fund ($65,159) and one Sr. Construction Inspector to the Wastewater Fund ($83,970).  Both transfers were made to accurately reflect the inspection effort occurring for projects handled by these Funds.   Additional savings will be realized due to the retirement of an Operations Superintendent in Traffic Operations ($16,464); the transfer of one (1) vacant Administrative Assistant II position to the new Customer Service - 311 Call Center ($37,887); the elimination of one (1) filled Architect II position ($55,806), and the elimination of two (2) filled Surveying Technicians ($105,919).   In addition, the Work Performed for Others account in Architectural Services has been reduced to more closely align the budget with historical and projected expense levels.   Public Works

 – The department was able to streamline operations and cut contractual services to find more than ($350,000) in savings.  An additional ($578,000) will be reduced from street paving and reconstruction, as much work has been done in recent years to improve street resurfacing.  Two (2) vacant positions (Electronic Technician and Maintenance Specialist) will be eliminated and the work spread to existing employees at a savings of nearly ($100,000).  In an effort to enhance the City’s “Green” initiatives, the Department has created a Sustainability Division, adding one new position ($46,606) and reclassifying another, which will improve energy efficiencies and enhance environmental 

FY 2013 Recommended Budget - Page 57




 FY 2013 Recommended Budget – General Fund, Continued  causes.  In addition, part-time security officers will be hired to work at the City’s new Denbigh Community Center.  Total net reductions for the Department equal more than ($1,000,000).   Health

 - The Peninsula Health Department’s State Cooperative Budget Request was based on the premise that the Peninsula Health District will receive reduced

 State funding for FY 2013, increased contractual services for Lease costs, and no wage increase anticipated to be given to State employees.  In addition, the State will require its departments to absorb any costs associated with increased amounts for VRS payments for State employees.  It is anticipated that there will be no change in revenues from patient paid fees over the current year’s estimate.  Therefore, the Local Share Match based on the proposed Health Department State Budget request is $1,892,389.  This is a reduction from the current year of ($94,152), or (4.7%), less than the current budgeted amount of $1,986,541.     Beginning in FY 2012, the City began funding the Adult Services Dental Clinic program at $120,000.  The Dental Clinic is a non-mandated function for the Health Department and with continued reduced State revenue to the Health Department; it was targeted for state cuts.    For FY 2011, in 1,840 District-wide visits to the Clinic, 1,672 were new patients. This City amount contractually funds 35% of the salary and fringe benefits cost of two dentist positions, and 100% of a third dental technician.  This cost would be 100% City cost, and not refundable through the State reimbursement process. By providing this annual support, this service would be retained.  Mental Health

 – The Hampton-Newport News Community Services Board’s FY 2013 Recommended Budget is $1,523,521 and reflects no change in funding from the prior year.        Human Services

 – The Department’s FY 2013 recommended budget reflects two very different types of reductions.  The first is a programmatic State reduction for Day Care services, and the second is 

FY 2013 Recommended Budget - Page 58




 FY 2013 Recommended Budget – General Fund, Continued  operational reductions.   Although significant, these reductions are not expected to impact the Department’s ability to properly staff or operate.  For the program reduction of Day Care services, the Virginia Department of Social Services took over administering day care payments to vendors in January of 2012.  The City is no longer obligated to make these payments.  Although these were primarily pass-through in nature, the City was obligated to match certain types of expenses.  Typically, the City’s match requirements averaged between $200,000 to $450,000 per year.  In FY 2012, the total program costs budgeted for Day Care was $6,951,000.  This has been eliminated from the FY 2013 budget in both the Department and $5,130,000 in General Fund revenues.    In recent years, the Department has been operating with many vacancies even with a concerted effort to fully staff the Department.  The Department has averaged 66 vacant positions annually.  Although an attrition credit equal to roughly 36 positions has been used for several years, there does appear to be room for additional savings.   Accordingly, in FY 2013, an additional 12 positions, or $600,000, are being added to the attrition credit for a total of ($2,400,000) (an Attrition Credit reduces a Department’s budget for salaries and fringe benefits based on an anticipated lag time between an employee termination and when a new employee is hired).  This is not expected to impact the Department’s ability to hire and properly staff.    Funding of the Comprehensive Services Act (CSA) Fund is recommended to decline by ($465,000), to $757,990.  CSA program costs have been declining for several years now, as well as State funding for the program.  The CSA Fund Balance, which was $2.7 million at the beginning of the FY 2012 fiscal year, is deemed adequate to cover FY 2013 contingent needs should expenses change.  Other program expense reductions are recommended in ADC Foster Care ($154,000) to more closely represent current year activity.  City Attorney legal work performed for the Department is also expected to decline by $125,000, as noted in City Attorney Department section; Contractual Services in this Department have been reduced to offset the change in the City Attorney’s Department.  Increased expenses of $75,000 

FY 2013 Recommended Budget - Page 59




 FY 2013 Recommended Budget – General Fund, Continued  are recommended for the Cooperative Extension Division for a change in the staffing agreement and for increased rent in FY 2013.  In addition, increases in Rouse Tower rent of $55,000 and software maintenance of $35,000 are recommended.   Parks, Recreation and Tourism

 - Various line items including Contractual Services, Travel/Training, Wearing Apparel, Educational/Training Supplies, Utilities, and Equipment Replacement/Repair were reduced totaling ($129,113).  The rent cost of the Senior Program will be reduced by moving the program from the Disabled American Veterans building to the Denbigh Community Center ($15,000).  General Fund Support to the Special Events Fund was reduced ($13,250) (this funding is found in the Payments to Other Funds division of the General Fund, under the Nondepartmental Tab of this book).  There is the  elimination of two (2) full-time positions which includes one (1) Administrator of Financial Services ($107,223) and one (1) Historic Site Curator ($58,416) (this position is in the Historical Services Fund; the reduction would come from the Nondepartmental annual contribution to the Fund).  Funding has been added for a full-year of operations for the Denbigh Community Center in the amount of $701,661.   This amount is in addition to the $139,594 in the FY 2012 budget, and includes the addition of three (3) full time positions.  When including funds from Public Works and Information Technology, full cost of operations at the Denbigh Community Center is $720,829 for FY 2013.  Also, additional contracts to provide landscape maintenance were added in the amount of $126,716.  In addition, the departmental Attrition Credit was reduced in the amount of ($54,594) from $654,594 to $600,000                 (an Attrition Credit reduces a Department’s budget for salaries and fringe benefits based on an anticipated lag time between an employee termination and when a new employee is hired).      Libraries and Information Services

 – Bookmobile service is recommended to be eliminated in FY 2013, resulting in the elimination of one (1) Information Services Specialist position and one part time position, which will generate a savings of ($100,000).  As the book collection was loaned out from the Main Street Library, it will be integrated back into that branch.  In addition, one part time Library 

FY 2013 Recommended Budget - Page 60




 FY 2013 Recommended Budget – General Fund, Continued  Technician will be eliminated in the Technical Services Division ($12,595).  This is due in part to continuing reductions in the State Aid to Localities, resulting in reductions in the Library materials’ budget.  Reductions totaling ($28,397) were also made to various operational expenses such as Contractual Services, Printing and Supplies to more properly align the budget with projected expense levels.   Development

 - As a result of lower bond interest expense and increased lease income at Rouse Towers, as well as lower maintenance and operating costs, the Department was able to reduce debt service expense and City Center Garage Maintenance expense by ($120,000).  This is found in the Payments to Other Funds cost center of the General Fund.  In addition, funding is included for an increase in the City’s share of the Business Development Specialist position ($12,043) due to reduced CDBG funds.    Planning 

- Reductions were made to various operating expenses totaling ($9,000).  The Department’s expenses are predominantly labor related.  Retirements in the first half of the fiscal year will contribute an additional ($65,000) in departmental savings, with one position being frozen for the remainder of the year. The Department has requested $40,000 to perform the required update to the Framework for the Future.  The survey will also include additional questions pertinent to obtaining measures from the citizens to be used in the development of the Balanced Scorecard. These funds are budgeted in the Nondepartmental-Contingencies division of the General Fund under the Nondepartmental Tab of this book.     Customer Service – 311 Call Center

 – This new department will 311 Call Center technology to improve City communications with citizens via a “one-stop-shop” to answer questions and receive citizen concerns and issues.  Funding of $35,519 was included in the FY 2012 budget for partial-year funding of 

FY 2013 Recommended Budget - Page 61




 FY 2013 Recommended Budget – General Fund, Continued  one position.  The total funding recommended for this Department for FY 2013 is $332,508, which represents an increase of $296,989 over FY 2012.  This includes funding for six full time positions and one part time position ($304,582) of which three positions will be shifted from the Information Technology, Codes Compliance, and Engineering Departments.  The remaining funds will be used for overall operating expenses such as Contractual Services, Telecommunications and Supplies ($27,926).        Nondepartmental - Contingencies

 - Reductions were made to various Appointed Boards’ operating expense line items totaling ($4,764).  The Nondepartmental-Contingencies Division reflects a change in the fundamental method of budgeting for overall Retirement costs.  This change results in an increase of $35,700,112 over FY 2012.  This increase is primarily due to the transfer of retirement contributions from the individual operating departments to this Division to increase transparency, improve year to year comparisons, and for better fiscal control.  This includes all costs for both City and VRS retirement obligations.  This increase also includes funding to provide a 1.5% salary adjustment for employees on January 1, 2013 of $1,000,000.  Also included is targeted funding for adjustments recommended in the compensation study ($500,000).  The remaining increases include funding for Line of Duty Benefits (up to $450,000 from $221,727), the Framework for the Future Survey ($40,000), funding to continue the LINC (applicant tracking system) contract for six additional months ($13,200), funding for South Morrison Workforce Development ($75,000), funding for grass cutting for city-owned lots as part of the City’s Community Maintenance initiatives ($20,000), Balanced Scorecard Training ($10,000), the annual increase for the Oyster Point Town Center Lease ($16,460), and additional funding to support the 2012 Presidential Election ($122,778).  These increases were offset by the following decreases:  Medical Services Contracts for the Juvenile Services Department ($52,875), Pet Licensing Program ($24,000), Public Safety Promotional Training ($93,000), Annual Police Academy Fee ($15,984), Human Resources Organizational Development Training ($20,000), elimination of the 2600 Building lease contract ($8,001), City Council Contingency 

FY 2013 Recommended Budget - Page 62




 FY 2013 Recommended Budget – General Fund, Continued  funding ($100,000), and Virginia Power ($99,391).  The majority of these decreases reflect aligning the budget with historical expenditure patterns.   Payments to Other Funds

 – The increases, which total $1,697,516, are primarily attributed to the following:  additional Contribution to the School Fund ($1,200,000), Enterprise Zone Benefit ($332,990) as additional companies becoming eligible for program reimbursements in FY 2013, Stormwater Management Fee ($103,683) due to the proposed FY 2013 rate increase, and Debt Service ($288,754), which is a net amount that reflects $1.2 million in FY 2012 General Fund bond refunding savings and full year costs for the July 2011 issue.  These increases were offset by decreases in General Fund Support to the Historical Services Fund ($10,000), Payment to the Economic Industrial Development Fund – Marketing ($75,000), and Special Event Funding ($63,500).  While reductions were made in the FY 2013 contribution to Special Events, there are sufficient reserves in that Fund to support the annual programs.

Although the Fund will experiencesignificant increases to retirement contributions and health care funding, it has been able to reduce its budget by more than ($1,400,000) through other expenditure reductions.  These reductions will be made by extending a hiring lag, attrition credits, deferring or eliminating programs and reducing operational expenditures.  As conservationefforts continue to rise, demand for water consumption is declining.  Water demand for

In response to this occurrence, in FY 2012, Public Utilities established a new rate structure that allowed revenues to be more equitably distributed between fixed and variable costs.  In recent years, the Fund was able to budget some Use of Reserves to offset otherwise necessary rate increases.  To continue that plan would be detrimental to the long term fiscal health of the Fund.  As a result, the Fund must recommend a slight rate increase to meet the fixed cost portion of the continuing drop in demand.  Specific recommended rate changes are shown below.  The net increase for all rate changes for the average household are $2.33 per month or less than $28.00 per year.

The Fundincrease is reflective of significant changes in federal and state approaches to stormwater management.  Changes are embodied in two major components -the Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) and the Chesapeake Bay Preservation Act Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDL's).  Due to these mandates the Fund will increase by three positions (Sr. Environmental Inspector, Environmental Specialist, and Sr. Construction Inspector) to perform the necessary work associated with MS4 and TMDL's.   Two Inspector positions and one Environmental Specialist are being created.  In addition, General Capital Improvement funds must increase, as well as, funds for

A slight increase in the Solid WasteRevolving Fund is attributed to continued requirements to properly fund the City's retirement system and health care costs.  Because reductions to service levels are not being imposed for FY 2013, it is necessary to recommend a slight weekly increase to the Solid Waste Fee.  The fee is recommended to increase by $0.10 per week for the average household.

The Wastewater Fund continues to operate under the Department of Environmental  Quality's (DEQ) Special Order by Consent (SOC).  The City is in process of shifting from the SOC's initial investigative requirement for the system's processes and infrastructure to the required rehabilitation phase.  As a result of DEQ's mandate, costs for the Fund are expected to increase greatly over the coming years.  For FY 2013, the Fund will add two (2) new positions (Sr. Construction Inspector and Wastewater Inspector) and increase funding for rehabilitation of the sewer system.

 years ago the Fund established a separate surcharge to cover the cost of the initial investigative stage of DEQ's mandate.  However, as the City transitions to the rehabilitation phase, which is expected to continue for the foreseeable future, it is appropriate to combine the regular Sewer User Fee with the SOC surcharge, as this work is the "new normal" for Wastewater operations.  To cover the cost of DEQ's mandate, it is necessary to increase the combined Sewer User Fee by $0.26 per hundred cubic feet (HCF).  The total increase for the average household is approximately $23.40 per year.

 Course Revolving Fund, and Leeward Marina Fund, FY 2013 budgets include no changes to the levels of service provided in the current fiscal year.  An Attrition Credit has been applied to the Recreation Revolving Fund to capture savings projected from normal levels of position vacancy.  (An Attrition Credit reduces a Department’s budget based on an anticipated lag time between an employee termination and when a new employee is hired).The Historical Services Fund budget reflects a net decrease of ($8,300) or (0.7%)  from the FY 2012 Operating Budget.  This expenditure reduction is driven by the elimination of one (1) Historical Site Curator position ($58,416).The Tourism, Promotion, and Development Fund budget reflects an increase of $67,900 from the FY 2012 budget level.  FY 2013 Lodging Tax revenue, which 46.67% of the General Fund revenue collection is allocated to this Fund as revenue, is expected to continue the recovery experienced in FY 2012.  The anticipated General Fund FY 2013 Lodging Tax revenue growth is the reason for the increase in the Fund, and will be used to offset the cost of the increased Retirement and Health Insurance Premium increases, and additional costs associated the City’s Indirect Cost allocation charges.

The total funding requested by Community Support agencies and Regional Organizations for FY 2013 was $9,711,365. This representsa 24% increase over FY 2012 funding levels, or $1,847,310.  The FY 2013 recommended support level  is $8,504,876, representing  an increase of $640,821, or 8.1%.  The vast majority of agency funding was maintained at FY 2012 levels, with some increases and decreases where appropriate.   The RegionalOrganization increase of $600,821 is primarily the result of one agency, Hampton Roads Transit, which is recommended  to receive a net increase of $696,230.Community Support

Five new applicants applied for grant monies in FY 2013.  Given our current fiscal environment, none of these agencies are recommended to receive funding in FY 2013.   All existing Community Support agency grant recipients  are recommended to be funded at FY 2012 levels,with one exception.  The Office of Human Affairs (OHA) is recommended to receive a $40,000 increase.   In January, a License and Lease Agreement was arranged between OHA and the City, at City Council's direction, to formalize the leasing arrangement  at four City owned properties which OHA occupies space.   These Agreements resulted in OHA having to reimburse the City for its share of utilities at these facilities going forward.  The annual utility cost to OHA is estimatedtobe $42,000.  In exchange for this, the City has decided to increase its Community Support funding to OHA by $40,000.  This also serves to provide incentive for OHA staff to manage their utility usage consistent with City Department personnel.Regional Organizations

The Hampton Roads Sports Commission is the only Regional Organization recommended to lose their entire funding.  Since FY 2013 is not an AAU program year and no other Peninsula localities are funding the Sports Commission, the recommendation is to eliminate funding this year.   Three Regional Organizations are recommended for a  5% reduction in funding:  the Hampton Roads Economic Development Alliance, the Hampton Roads Military and Federal Facilities Alliance, and the Hampton Roads Partnership.   A 2.5% reduction is recommended for Thomas NelsonCommunity College's capital improvement request.  However,  Thomas Nelson's Workforce Development request is recommended to receive funding at last year's level.    Several Regional Organizations requested small reductions from FY 2012.  In those cases, their funding is recommended at the reduced level.  The Regional Air Service Enhancement Fund (RAISE) is recommended to be reduced by $72,288, which coincides with the increased funding the Economic Development Authority (EDA) is providing.  RAISE also requested a $313 reduction, which is reflected in the recommended amount.   Contingency funding  of $30,000 is recommended and earmarked for the PORT Winter Shelter program.  This will provide monies foran additional four weeks of PORT Winter shelter emergency, if needed.  Hampton Roads Transit (HRT) has requested an FY 2013 increase of $468,000 more than their FY 2012 request.  In FY 2012, the City funded  HRT flat with FY 2011, taking advantage of a $366,000 credit HRT had provided.   This also resulted in a $134,000 FY 2012 shortfall from what HRT had requested.   All of these factors result in the $946,000 HRT requested increase over FY 2012 funding level.   HRT's costs have increased  7.4% and 9.4% in FY 2012 and FY 2013, respectively.  HRT has not raised  passenger fares since 2000.  The recommended  FY 2013 funding for HRT is an increase of $696,230 (to $5,200,640).

The Commission conducts an Economic Impact Study after large events to determine the impact to the region through hotels, restaurants, attractions, etc.  Other participating localities include Virginia Beach, Norfolk, Hampton, Suffolk, Portsmouth, and Chesapeake.

Capital funds are also included with the HRT request as a 20% local match required for HRT to obtain federal funds for capital (bus) replacement.

FY 2013 Recommended Budget - Page 107




based on the total cost of operations for the Agency as compared to the amount of the locality funding during the fiscal year.  HRT requested $4,981,812 from the City in FY 2012.  This represented an increase of $343,370 over FY 2011.  However, HRT notified the City that it had a $367,000 credit available to use (pertaining to 2010).  In response to this, the City funded HRT at the FY 2011 level of $4,504,410 in cash and used the available credit to fund the FY 2012 HRT request.  The credit was used to keep the funding level flat.    Recently, HRT notified the City of a $401,207 additional charge pertaining to FY 2011.  These monies will need to be paid either in the fourth quarter of FY 2012, or throughout FY 2013.  HRT has also requested an FY 2013 budget of $5,450,640.  This represents an increase of $468,828 over the FY 2012 amount requested.    An efficiency study was conducted in FY 2011 resulting in some recent route changes which began in January of 2012.  HRT has not raised its passenger fees since 2000.  HRT uses a cost allocation approach to charge the localities, which mitigates savings or increased costs that a locality may have.     The City Manager recommends funding of $5,200,640 in FY 2013 for this Regional Organization.  FY 2013 Request     $5,450,640 ($5,185,102 operating and $265,538 capital) FY 2013 Recommendation   $5,200,640 ($4,935,102 operating and $265,538 capital)   11.
