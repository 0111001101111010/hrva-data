1,"1 - Written Standards of Conduct  [FTA C 4220.1F, ¶ III, 1.a.,b.,&c.] ","The HRT Personnel Manual contains most of the required conflict of interest coverage. It needs to be expanded to include the underlined portion of the personal conflicts of interest paragraph above (Personal Conflicts of Interest, Gifts, and Violations).","Within 30 days of the date of this report HRT should amend its Personnel Manual to include the expanded coverage of who may not participate in the selection, award, or administration of a contract supported with FTA assistance. It is also advised that HRT should, on an annual basis, require all employees who participate in the procurement process to sign an assurance that they have read, understand, and will comply with HRT’s personal conflicts of interest policy. ","1. The Personnel Manual will be amended to include expanded coverage of  Personal Conflicts of Interest, Gifts, and Violations, identifying who  may not participate in the selection, award, or administration of a contract supported with FTA assistance.  

2. On an annual basis, HRT will require all employees who participate in the procurement process to sign a certification that they have read, understand, and will comply with HRT’s personal conflicts of interest policy.  

3. Should it be determined that a personal conflict of interest exists, a process will be implemented to neutralize or mitigate the conflict, i.e. a change in personnel assignment.

2,"Element 2 – Contract Administration System [FTA C 4220.1F, ¶ III. 3.]","HRT does not have a documented contract administration system. Contract administration is a shared function between the program offices and the administrative office that has contract authority. However, specific responsibilities and duties for contract administration are not made specifically clear. 

Reporting and recording requirements are not specified. Contract administration duties such as tracking contract deliverables, schedules, progress payments with required incurred cost documentation, insurance, inspections, warranties, etc. are not specified. 

Program personnel are not informed of their authority or lack of authority to make changes to the contract or to direct the contractor within the scope of the contract. ","Within 120 days of the date of this report HRT should develop and implement a contract administration system (Manual) to ensure that it and its third party contractors comply with the terms, conditions, and specifications of their contracts or purchase orders and applicable Federal, State and local requirements. 

The Contract Administration Manual should cover all contract administration functions from contract award thru to contract close-out. It should describe each function and a system for assigning responsibility for its accomplishment, recordkeeping and reporting. 

A system for delegating contracting authority and setting the limits of that authority should be included in the Manual. [One effective method of assigning such responsibilities and also controlling the use of contracting officer authority is to use a letter of delegation to the employee responsible for the administration of a specific contract. The letter should list all functions the employee is responsible for and describe what contractual actions he or she may and may not take.  A place is provided on the letter for the employee to also sign and date his or her receipt of the delegation.



","A contract administration  system will be fully implemented within the Procurement department, to implement procedures and  management controls.   The procurement procedures manual will be amended to document the system requirements to include the following:

A. incorporation of all contract administration functions from pre-solicitation planning to contract award and administration through close out; 

B. expansion the contracting authority delegations to include contract administration personnel through  the use of a standard letter of delegation listing all functions of responsibility and describing allowed contractual actions by the contract administrator. The designee will be required to sign the letter, which will become permanent procurement record;

C. implementation of a written requisition for initiating all new procurement actions, identifying  the project manager, funding source,  scope of work, and independent cost estimate or identification of the esimator responsible for the independent cost estimate;  ",,,9/11/2011,Henry Li                   D. Purcell,Open
,,,"The Manual should include an effective “Change Control System” which ensures that all contract changes are priced and definitized in a timely manner. If a change cannot be priced before issuance because of some urgency, strict time limits should be set for the submission of the contractor’s price proposal and negotiation of the final contract modification. This will prevent the contract modification from becoming a cost-plus-percentage-of-cost arrangement. Such an arrangement exists when a product modification is priced after the work is performed and profit is allowed as a percentage of cost. ","D. a detailed review and written approval of solicitations and supporting contract administration files;  

E. a change control system to ensure contract modifications are priced, negotiated and executed in compliance with regulations,  and in a timely manner.  

F. Issuance of contract administration and project management delegation letters for each contract, which details the responsibilities and authority in the administrative and technical management of the contract.  The delegation letters will be maintained the in the official contract file.",,,,,
,,,,"Bi-weekly departmental training sessions will be used to implement  contracts administration functonal training, beginning with the deficiencies noted in the 2011 PSR and  continuing with ongoing training regarding the procurement process.  The amended procurement procedures manual  and the FTA Best Practices Procurement Manual will be used as training guides.",,,,,
3,"Element 3 – Written Protest Procedures [FTA C 4220.1F, ¶ VII,1.a.(2)]",HRT’s policies and procedures regarding protests were not clear with respect to these reporting requirements. ,Within 30 days of the date of this report HRT should amend its protest procedures to direct its employees to notify FTA of protests involving FTA funded contracts. Such procedures should include the information required by FTA Circular 4220.1 F. ,The Protest section of the procurement procedures manual  will be expanded to further clarify  and fully detail role and responsibilities regarding reporting and resolving  protests.  The contract administration system will implement procedures and management controls to ensure compliance.,,,6/20/2011,D. Purcell,Open
4,"Element 6 – Procurement Policies and Procedures [FTA C 4220.1F, ¶ III. 3.a.]","The following FTA requirements, listed by the FTA Circular paragraph number, were either not found or needed clarification:  1. “Organizational Conflicts of Interest.  [HRT’s policies and procedures contained a definition of organizational conflict of interest but did not provide guidance on how to mitigate or eliminate such conflicts in its contracting.]   Architectural Engineering (A&E) Services and Other Services.   [HRT’s policies and procedures do not clearly define the applicability of, and prohibitions regarding, qualifications-based procurement procedures relative to services such as program management, feasibility studies, preliminary engineering, design, surveying, mapping that do not lead directly to construction.]  [HRT’s policies and procedures regarding bonds contain a reference to the Virginia Public Procurement Act threshold for bonds at $250,000. It is not clear that all FTA assisted construction projects must be bonded above the small purchase threshold of $100,000.]  The review found a standard contract clause used in Invitations for Bids which stated that “The Commission may award to other than the low bidder.” 
",Within 30 days of the date of this report HRT should develop and implement policies and procedures that include the FTA Circular requirements shown above.,"The procurement procedures manual will be expanded to include checklists and templates notes above, to ensure conformance to Virginia Public Procurement Act and FTA Circular 4220.1F.  Standard clauses (general conditions) for invitations for bid and requests for proposals will be developed, to include mandatory federal requirements,  in compliance with C 4220.1F, to implement procedures and management controls.  The procurement procedures manual also will be expanded to include: 

1. Guidance on Organizational Conflicts of Interest; 

2. Clarifications regarding prohibitions of qualifications based procurement procedures outside of construction; 

3. Clarification that bonds are required for construction contracts above $100,000.
",,,6/20/2011,D. Purcell,Open
,,"[This is not appropriate for IFB’s. If the contractor is the low bidder and is determined to be responsive and responsible, the award must be made to that contractor. If other evaluation criteria are necessary, IFB is not the appropriate procurement method.] ",,,,,,,
5,Element 7 - Independent Cost Estimate ,"We reviewed 29 procurement files involving request for proposals, invitation for bids, sole source procurements and small purchases and found 20 files lacked supporting documentation indicating an adequate independent cost estimate had been performed by the recipient before the transit authority received bids or proposals. Our review found the recipient does not use a formal procurement requisition form to initiate the procurement process. This form is generated by the requiring organization. The independent cost estimate must be received before receipt of proposals and supported with detailed information as to its development and/or source; in other words how derived and by whom. The independent cost estimate becomes the first step in the cost/price reasonableness analysis. In the deficient procurement files, the in-house estimates were either not found or were budgetary type numbers without details to support the numbers or the origin of the numbers.","Within 30 days after the date of this report, the recipient should develop procedures and implement management controls to ensure that one of the first steps to be taken in connection with every procurement action is an independent cost or price estimate. This independent estimate should be completed before receiving bids or proposals and should be maintained in the official contract file. The Best Practices Procurement Manual Section 2.3.2 states “A final purpose of the independent cost estimate is for price analysis. Either a cost or price analysis is required for every contract and every change order so that the essential objective of a reasonable price is assured. The adequacy of the price or cost analysis is a critical responsibility of the contracting official. In many contract awards the bids alone may be adequate to assure a reasonable price. However, in all negotiated procurements, most contract changes, and sealed bids where price competition was not sufficient, further analysis is required. An independent cost estimate prepared before receipt of offers is invaluable in these circumstances. ","Standard procedures and  management controls will be implemented to require assignment of the independent cost estimator prior to beginning any  procurement action.  

Independent cost estimates shall be required to be completed prior to receipt of bids / proposals, and supported with detailed information as to its development and source.   

The independent cost estimate which will be maintained in the official contract file will be used as the first step in the  cost / price analysis.  

The procurement procedures manual will be expanded to include detailed implementation and guidance of the required process.  Training will be implemented, as required.",,,6/20/2011,D. Purcell,Open
,,,"The estimate alone may, if prepared with sufficient detail and reliability in the contracting official’s judgment, be sufficient to determine whether the price is reasonable. It will at least supplement other pricing data in making the determination of reasonableness. Because cost analysis can be time consuming, expensive, and raise disputes, the availability of an independent pre-bid estimate which enables price analysis and obviates cost analysis is worth material pre-bid effort.”",,,,,,
6,Element 13 - Brand Name Restrictions ,"We reviewed five procurement files involving small purchases, request for proposals, invitation for bids, and sole source procurements using brand names and found two procurement files failed to cite an or equal or a description of the salient physical or functional characteristics needed. If only a brand name was required the files did not contain properly approved sole source justifications.","Within 30 days after the date of this report, the recipient should develop procedures and implement management controls to ensure that when using “brand name or equal” purchase descriptions will carefully identify the recipient’s minimum needs and clearly set forth those salient physical and functional characteristics of the brand name product in the solicitation. When using a ""brand name"" specification, the recipient does not need to reverse-engineer a complicated part to identify precise measurements or specifications in order to describe its salient characteristics. FTA's ""Best Practices Procurement Manual,"" (BPPM) contains additional information on preparation of specifications including examples with specific language.","Standard procedures and management controls  will be implemented to establish and used standard general terms and conditions.  The general terms and conditions will  include a standardized brand name or equal clause.  

A management control procedure will be implemented to review  solicitations in detail, prior to issuance, to ensure compliance.  

The review process will include ensuring that when using a brand name or equal specification,  the solicitation specifications clearly identify minimum needs and salient physical and functional characteristics of the brand named product.  The FTA Best Practices Manual will be used as a guide.",,,6/20/2011,D. Purcell,Open
7,Element 18 - Award to Responsible Contractors ,"We reviewed 27 procurement files involving request for proposals, invitation for bids, and sole source procurement and found four files lacked documentation that would indicate a determination had been made that the successful contractor was considered responsible prior to making the award. It should be noted in those files where the recipient had evaluated such responsibility matters as part of the evaluation and award process we found the recipient not deficient. The deficient procurement files lacked a written determination or any indication this issue had been considered.","Within 30 days after the date of this report, the recipient should develop procedures and implement management controls to ensure that awards are made only to responsible contractors. The contractor must be considered responsible in order to receive an award regardless of the procurement method used to select the contractor. To be considered responsible, a contractor must meet all the following requirements:  (a) Financial resources adequate to perform the contract, or the ability to obtain them, (b) Ability to meet the required delivery or performance schedule, taking into consideration all existing commercial and government business commitments, (c) A satisfactory performance record, (d) A satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics, (e) The necessary organization, experience, accounting, and operational controls, and technical skills, or the ability to obtain them, (f) Compliance with applicable licensing and tax laws and regulations, (g) The necessary production, construction, and technical equipment and facilities, or the ability to obtain them, 
(h) Compliance with Affirmative Action and Disadvantaged Business Program requirements and, (i) Other qualifications and eligibility criteria necessary to receive an award under applicable laws and regulations.   ","Procedures and management controls  will be implemented to include a responsibility review check list, which will be used for all contractor evaluations prior to award of a contract.  The checklist will require review and confirmation of the following:  

1. Excluded parties list; 
2. Certificate of insurance and surety; 
3. Disadvantages Business Enterprise participation goals;
4. Financial resources;
5. Bonds
6. Technical qualifications and experience
7. Past performances, to ensure ability to maintain schedule and completion of work; 
8. Integrity and business ethics; 
9. Operational experience and capability; 
10. History of compliance with regulations and requirements
11. Applicable licensing and certifications; 
12. Other verifications as may be deemed appropriate.  
Where appropriate,  the written record will state the specific basis for a responsibility determination. When an offer is rejected because the prospective contractor is found to be not responsible, a signed determination of non-responsibility, stating the basis for the determination, with all supporting documentation, will be maintained in the official contract file. 
",,,6/20/2011,D. Purcell,Open
,,,"While the award of a contract itself can in some instances be considered as implicit affirmation that a contractor has been determined to be responsible, where appropriate the written record should state the specific basis for a responsibility determination. When an offer, on which an award would otherwise be made, is rejected because the prospective contractor is found to be not responsible, the recipient should make, sign, and place in the file a determination of non-responsibility, which states the basis for this determination. Documents and reports supporting a determination of responsibility or non-responsibility, including any pre-award survey reports, should be included in the contract file.",,,,,,
8,Element 19 - Sound and Complete Agreement ,"We reviewed 28 procurement files involving request for proposals, invitation for bids, and sole source to determine if the resulting contract (s) formed a sound and complete agreement. Twenty-seven procurement files were found to be adequate in meeting the requirements for this element and one procurement file was found deficient. In that particular procurement file, the contract had been allowed to lapse and the requirement was continued by the issuance of multiple purchase orders without the benefit of a contract supported by all the FTA required sole source approval and procurement documentation.","Within 30 days after the date of this report, the recipient should develop procedures and implement management controls to ensure its requirements are covered by a contract that any resultant award is a sound and complete agreement and reflects the understandings of the parties. The contract should take precedence over all other contract documents. Where applicable, the contract or award documents must include all terms and conditions, the negotiated contract price and payment terms, the final statement of work or specification, the delivery schedules and the required clauses including termination for cause and termination for convenience and the basis for settlement. This document should be, as nearly as possible, a stand-alone document in which all the applicable attachments and exhibits are part of the award. A requirement for management review of proposed contracts is a good method of assuring the completeness and soundness of contracts.","All contracts require approval in accordance with the procurement procedures manual.  

All contracts will be reviewed by management prior to approval of the contract for issuance.  standard procedures and  management controls  will be implemented to track all open contracts, to include maintaining visibility and management of  contract  periods of performance. 

 The management system will ensure that procurement requirements are covered by a sound and complete contract.  Within 90 days prior to contract expiration, the project manager will be notified by the contract administrator, to begin closeout of the expiring contract and planning for any  continued requirements.  

New competitive procurements will be enacted for all continuing requirements.   Where interim purchase orders become necessary, they will be supported by FTA required sole source justifications, documentation and approvals, which will be maintained in the official contract file.",,,6/20/2011,D. Purcell,Open
9,Element 21 - Fair and Reasonable Price Determination ,We reviewed 11 procurement files involving micro-purchases and found four procurement files did not contain the required minimum documentation stating the price was fair and reasonable and how the determination was derived.,"Within 30 days after the date of this report the recipient should develop procedures and implement management controls to ensure that all micro-purchase procurement files contain minimum documentation that the price is fair and reasonable. For micro-purchases a fair and reasonable price determination is made based on price analysis. The Best Practices Procurement Manual, Section 5.2, provides some common price analysis techniques as follows:  1. Comparison of proposed prices received in response to the solicitation. 
2. Comparison of prices received with prior procurement actions for the same or similar end items. Prior price comparison may be affected by:  Changes in economic conditions between the times of the two procurements; 
3. Differences in quantities; 
4. Inclusion of nonrecurring cost in the prices. To make a fair comparison, nonrecurring costs can be removed from both prices. 
5. Comparison with competitive published price lists, published market price of commodities, similar indexes, and discount or rebate arrangements.
6. Comparison of proposed prices with the cost estimates performed prior to the solicitation, although this alone is seldom adequate to warrant a determination that the price is fair and reasonable. 
","Standard procedures and a management control system  will be implemented to verify the completeness of the procurement records, and ensure file documentation is maintained to establish price reasonableness.  

The procedure will require that micro-purchase procurement files contain written determination that the price is fair and reasonable, including detailing the  basis for the determination.  

A standard form will be developed and implemented for this purpose.",,,6/20/2011,D. Purcell,Open
10,Element 25 – Adequate Competition - Two or More Bidders ,We reviewed nineteen procurement files involving request for proposals and invitations for bids and found two instances where the contract files failed to contain documentation reflecting two or more responsible bidders were not willing and able to compete for the business.,"Within 30 days of the date of this report, the recipient should develop procedures and implement management controls to ensure that invitation for bid and request for proposal solicitations are publicly advertised in a timely manner and sent to an adequate number of qualified suppliers. When only one offer is received, the procurement files should be documented to so reflect the reasons why this occurred and what actions are to be taken to mitigate its happening in the future.","Standard procedures and a management control system will be implemented to ensure all small purchases are supported by two or more competitive bids.  When competitive bids cannot be obtained, the file shall detail the procurement efforts and document mitigating procedures for obtaining competition.  All planned procurement actions estimated to be above $100,000 will be posted to HRT’s website as upcoming, upon receipt of the procurement requisition.  Legal notices (ads) will run in appropriate publications, to publish the solicitation.  Post solicitation surveys will be completed to document reasons when only 1 or no bids are received.  Mitigating actions will be implemented when this occurs.  Plan holders lists and survey results will be maintained in the official contract file.",,,6/20/2011,D. Purcell,Open
11,Element 32 – Bid Opening ,"We reviewed nine procurement files involving invitation for bids and found two procurement files deficient. The deficiency in these procurement files centers on the lack of documentation to support the actual bid opening. There was documentation in the procurement file and or solicitation to support a public opening was contemplated. The seven non deficient files had advertised the pubic openings and the files contained bid abstracts recording the bid prices. The documentation should also contain evidence of timely opening, persons in attendance, and any anomalies. Further, in this era of heightened security it is more important than ever to not only identify the location and room but also any procedures necessary to gain access to that bid opening location.","Within 30 days after the date of this report, the recipient should develop procedures and implement management controls to insure that solicitations are clear regarding the public bid opening and the procurement files properly document the bid opening. This documentation should include sign-in sheets to reflect attendance by the public or any other officials or any documentation regarding any unusual actions or reactions that may have occurred on the part of potential offerors during the bid opening. The recipient should refer to Best Practices Procurement Manual, Section 4.4.2, for additional details on the process of receiving bids and the opening, reading, and recording of bids. A record of this procedure should be placed in the official procurement file. Overall, the recipient did a good job in this area.","The procurement procedures manual and standard practices will be amended to ensure bid opening documentation is maintained in the official contract file.  

Review of the contract files to ensure completeness will be an established standard practice and management control procedure.  Standard practices will include documentation of unusual actions during bid openings.  

The documentation will be maintained in the official contract file. Bid opening information is published in the legal notices, on HRT’s website,  and in the solicitation package.  

Bid results are read publically and recorded.  Sign in sheets and bid opening records will be maintained in the official contract file.  ",,,6/20/2011,D. Purcell,Open
12,Element 38 – Sole Source if Other Award is Infeasible ,We reviewed nine noncompetitive procurement files involving sole sources and found four procurement files deficient. We were unable in the first deficient file for “Spear” modules to find a sole source justification. In the last three deficient procurement files it was discerned by the recipient the situation was such under a prime contract that it became necessary to contract directly with several subcontractors under said prime contract. The procurement files failed to contain properly justified and approved sole source documents.,"Within 30 days after the date of this report, the recipient should develop procedures and implement management controls consistent with the FTA Circular that avoid using sole source procurement except in circumstances where it is both necessary and in the best interest of the recipient. When a noncompetitive procurement is necessary in circumstances other than those in the FTA Circular paragraphs (VI, 3, I(1)(b), shown above, the recipient should ensure that FTA approval is obtained. Before using the sole source method of procurement, first determine that the desired requirements cannot be obtained under small purchase procedures, sealed bids, or competitive proposals. If one of these three methods can be used (or is feasible), sole source is not an option. When the sole source procurement method is used, the files should provide justification for using this method of purchase and for using the particular vendor selected. The file should contain a proper and timely approved sole source justification, which reflects the requirements and periods of performance. Adding additional items or requirements or additional periods of time of performance require additional sole source justification.","Standard procedures and management controls will be implemented to ensure full and open competition in compliance with the FTA Circular 4220.1F, except in cases where it is determined both necessary and in the agency’s best interest.  

When non-competitive procurement is necessary and in HRT’s best interest,  a written sole source justification, supporting documentation, and required approvals will be maintained in the official contract file.",,,6/20/2011,D. Purcell,Open
13,Element 39 - Cost Analysis Required [Sole Source] ,We reviewed nine noncompetitive procurement files and found six procurement files did not contain documentation to support that an adequate cost analysis had been performed. There was no element by element analysis or discussion of the cost or profit and no evidence of any negotiations being conducted. Detailed,"Within 30 days after the date of this report, the recipient should develop procedures and implement management controls to ensure that an adequate cost analysis is performed for all sole source procurements. A contract file checklist and a review by the manager or supervisor are a good way of ensuring compliance with this element. The analysis should be documented in the contract or purchase order file. The cost analysis should include an evaluation of labor, materials, other direct costs, overhead rates, G&A rates, and a profit factor. When negotiations take place, the file should be documented to reflect the results of the negotiations and the rationale behind the agreements reached.","A cost analysis checklist will be developed and used to complete required analyses, as a standard procedure.  

The analyses and supporting documentation will be reviewed and approved by management upon completion, as part of the management control process.  

A record of negotiation will be included in the procurement summary and maintained in the official contract file.  As standard practice, in all non-competitive awards, a most favored customer clause will be included.  

The procurement procedures manual will be amended to include completion guidelines for implementation of this requirement.",,,6/20/2011,D. Purcell,Open
14,Element 41 - Cost or Price Analysis ,"We reviewed 20 procurement files involving request for proposals, invitations for bids and small purchases and found seven deficient procurement files. Basically the deficiency resulted from a general lack of detailed documentation to support the results of a cost or price analysis or whether a cost or price analysis had ever been performed. In those procurement files where adequate competition existed and award was made to the lowest offeror, the recipient was found not deficient; however, the procurement files should be documented to reflect this decision. In files where adequate competition exists and the selection is made, there always exists the possibility that negotiations may be necessary.","Within 30 days after the date of this report, the recipient should develop procedures and implement management controls to ensure that cost or price analysis is conducted, consistent with Federal cost principles, for all applicable procurements and documented in the procurement files. ","standard procedures and management controls will be implemented to include the cost or price analysis checklist.  

The checklist, consistent with federal cost principles,  will be implemented to conduct and manage cost or price analyses.  Cost and price analyses will be reviewed by management to ensure compliance.  

Department training will include cost and price analysis.  

The analyses and supporting documentation will be maintained in the official contract file.  ",,,6/20/2011,D. Purcell,Open
15,Element 42 - Written Record of Procurement History ,"We reviewed 29 procurement files involving request for proposals, invitation for bids, sole source procurements, and small purchases for evidence of a written record of procurement history and found nine files did not contain an adequate procurement history or file documentation. The recommendations for award resulting from the proposal evaluations should explain the basis for the contract price, and any tradeoffs between the technical and cost/price proposals, and why the recipient considers the final price to be fair and reasonable. In some procurement files, the reviewers were able to","Within 30 days after the date of this report, the recipient should develop procedures that facilitate management controls to ensure that procurement files are properly documented with evidence supporting the determinations made during each stage of the procurement process. A complete contract file checklist is a good management review tool to achieve this purpose. The documentation should include:  (a) Rationale for the method of procurement; 
(b) Independent Cost Estimates; 
(c) Copies of published notices of proposed contract action; 
(d) The evaluations of bids and selections of firms for negotiations and award; 
(e) The costs negotiated by the parties and the determination that the price is fair and reasonable; 
(f) A cost or price analysis, as appropriate; 
(g) A summary record of negotiations, if appropriate; and 
(h) All correspondence and data in support of relevant contractual actions. 
Procurement files should be a complete record of procurement actions and should fully support contractors' bid and price. If written quotes/bids are required, then these should become part of the file. If the procurement action is the result of a contract amendment or exercise of an option, sufficient data should be included to fully support the basis for the price and procurement action. ","Standard procedures and management controls will be implemented.  The procurement procedures manual will be amended to expand the explanation and requirement for a record of procurement history.  

A procurement summary checklist will be used to ensure complete and consistent development of  the record of the procurement.  The checklist will include rationale for the method of procurement; independent cost estimates; copies of published legal notices of the proposed procurement action; bid and proposal evaluation details; price reasonableness determinations; cost or price analyses; record of negotiations; and all supporting correspondence and data.   

The procurement summary will be maintained in the official contract file.",,,6/20/2011,D. Purcell,Open
16,Element 44 – Out of Scope Changes ,"We reviewed three contracts resulting from competitive procurements where the contracts were amended and found two procurement files deficient. The two deficient files were by the same contractor under two separate contracts (#30 & #40) for modifications which appeared to have been outside the general scope of the original contract. The contracts awarded after a sealed bid competition was amended to add requirements which were over and above the requirements outlined in the original request and the resultant contract. The added requirements called for work at two sites for communications ductwork. These amendments are considered new work and as such require compliance with FTA requirements for an approved sole source justification, a cost analysis, and cost and profit negotiations none of which were found in the procurement file.","Within 30 days after the date of this report, the recipient should develop and implement management controls to ensure that all contract amendments and change orders are within the scope of the contract. If the change is not within the scope of the original contract, it is considered a cardinal change. Such changes are not properly processed as being within the authority of the Changes clause. Such changes are a sole source and must be processed and handled as new work and treated as sole source procurements whereby appropriate approvals are obtained and that the procurement files are adequately documented. In the event a sole source cannot be justified, a competitive procurement action must be initiated.","A process and review procedure will be implemented to establish standard procedures and management controls to ensure proposed contract modifications and change orders are within the scope of the contract.    

If the proposed change is outside the original scope, it will be treated as a sole source, with the required sole source justification, cost analysis, documentation of negotiations, and required approvals maintained in the official contract file.",,,6/20/2011,D. Purcell,Open
17,Element 45 - Advance Payments ,"We reviewed 28 procurement files involving request for proposals, invitation for bids, and sole source procurements and found 26 to have complied regarding no payments to contractors prior to the incurrence of costs. However, we found two procurement files where advance payments had occurred. The first deficient file was the contract for the Light Rail Vehicles (LRVs). This particular deficiency was in the payment provisions for the basic contract, as well as for spare parts, tools, and test equipment described in the contract generally as follows:  Milestone Description Milestone % :  A. Written Notice to Proceed 10%; B. Upon Approval of Project Target Schedules 10% ; C. Upon Approval of Quality Assurance Plan 10% ; D. Contractor’s award of sub-contracts for main systems 20% The payments for milestones A through D represent 50% of the contract price of approximately $36, 016,518 or about 
","Within 30 days after the date of this report, the grantee should develop procedures and implement management controls to ensure that FTA approvals are obtained prior to entering into any contract, options under a contract, or into any task orders under a contract that contains advance payments where FTA funds are involved. The grantee must renegotiate the current progress payment provisions, eliminating the advance payments, before exercising any future options, or request and receive approval from the FTA to make advance payments.","Standard procedures and management controls  will be implemented to ensure that FTA approval is obtained prior to entering into any contract  where FTA funds are involved that contains an advance payment clause.   

Before exercising any future options for rail cars, spare parts, tools, and test equipment, HRT will eliminate the advance payments clause through  negotiations, or request and receive FTA approval to make advance payments.   

The second contract which was found deficient  provided for 50% upon award as a standard commercial practice for the product purchased.  In the future, where standard commercial practice exists to support the action, the file will be so documented, in accordance with FTA guidelines, and required approvals obtained.",,,6/20/2011,D. Purcell,Open
,,"$18,000,000.  The issuance of the Notice of Award and the Submission of the various schedules and plans and the awarding of sub-contracts would automatically require the payment of 50% of the total contract price before the incurrence of a great deal of such costs, and would therefore be an advance payment. Substantial portions of these plans usually already exist or are accomplished during the proposal preparation phase. The same can be said for the lining up of subcontractors and parts suppliers.   The second deficient file was the contract for temporary shelters for Light Rail Vehicles. This contract provided for the payment of 50% of the contract price, or $23,348, upon award of the contract. ",,,,,,,
18,Element 47 - Time and Materials Contracts ,"We reviewed seven procurement files involving request for proposals, invitations for bids, and small purchases and found six deficient procurement files. We found a failure to document the use of a time and materials type contracting and a failure to adequately control their cost liability with contract ceilings. These findings fall into two groupings; the first are entire contracts and the second is with contract changes within firm fixed price contracts. In the latter case, the finding is for a portion of these contracts and not the entire contract. Basically the deficiency resulted from a general lack of written documentation to justify the use of a time and materials type of contracting within these contracts and failure to the use of ceiling prices to limit the cost liability within these contracts. Time and materials pricing without a ceiling price is essentially a cost-plus-percentage-of-cost arrangement.","Within 30 days after the date of this report, the recipient should develop procures and implement management controls to ensure that use of time and material type contracting is conducted consistent with Federal cost principles, contracts and change orders have cost ceilings, costs are negotiated and all is documented in the procurement file.","Standard procedures and management controls will be implemented.  The procurement procedures  manual will be expanded to implement detailed procedures for documenting the use of a time and material type contract.  

Time and material contract files will include detailed written justification for the use of the methodology.  

Written procedures will be developed and implemented to control cost liability with contract ceilings (not to exceed pricing) and documented price negotiations, to preclude cost plus percentage of cost arrangements.",,,6/20/2011,D. Purcell,Open
19,Element 50 - Piggybacking ,"We reviewed two procurement files involving piggybacking; one for light rail cars from a City of Charlotte, North Carolina contract and the other for Gillig buses from a San Mateo County, California contract. The recipient’s deficient procurement file was the bus procurement which failed to contain a price reasonableness determination.","Within 30 days of the date of this report, the recipient should develop procedures and implement management controls to ensure that a determination is made that contract prices remain fair and reasonable at the time the requirement is acquired. FTA has historically encouraged recipients to consider combining efforts in their procurements to obtain better pricing through larger purchases. Recipients must ensure all federal requirements, required clauses, and certifications are properly followed and included in the resulting joint solicitation and contract documents.","Standard procedures and management controls will be implemented.  The procurement procedures manual will be expanded to implement additional detailed procedures and management controls for piggybacking., including  pre-award steps to determine that contract prices remain fair and reasonable.  A copy of the original contract will be reviewed to ensure that all federal requirements, required clauses and certifications are properly followed and included in the contract document.  Documentation of the review will be maintained in the official contract file.",,,,,
20,Pre-Award,"We reviewed ten bus procurement files and one light rail car procurement file relative to the required reviews and certifications. Nine of the ten bus procurements were piggyback procurements and one was a joint procurement. None of the Buy America Certifications, the Purchaser’s Requirements Certifications, and the required FMVSS Certifications were found in any of nine procurement files. It should be noted in the one light rail car file the Certifications were dated after the award date.",Refer to the Best Practices/Advisory Comments following the Post-Delivery Review Element.,"Refer to 21, Post-Delivery.",,,6/20/2011,D.

21,Post-Delivery,We reviewed ten bus procurement files and one light rail car procurement file relative to the required reviews and certifications. Nine of the ten bus procurements were piggyback procurements and one was a joint procurement. No Certifications were found in any of the procurement files.,"Within 30 days after the date of this report, the recipient should develop procedures and implement management controls to insure compliance with the Pre-Award and Post-Delivery requirements. The FTA Administrator’s Dear Colleague Letter C-97-03, dated March 18, 1997, and outlines the steps that a Recipient must take in performing pre-award and post-delivery reviews of rolling stock procurements to ensure their compliance with Buy America Act requirements. This Dear Colleague Letter may be found in Appendix A.2 of the Best Practices Procurement Manual. It must be stressed that Recipients are to document their reviews and include this documentation in their contract files as evidence that they have performed the required reviews. FTA has published manuals that provide detailed guidance to Recipients concerning which Buy America certifications and documents are needed to support the procurement process from issuance of the solicitation to title transfer, as well as the procedures that the Recipient may follow when conducting the pre-award and post-delivery reviews. There are also examples of Buy America calculations and responses to frequently asked questions. The manuals are: Conducting Pre-Award and Post-Delivery Reviews for Bus Procurements; Document No: FTA DC-90-7713-93-1, Rev. B, dated May 1, 1995 and Conducting Pre-Award and Post-Delivery Reviews for Rail Vehicle Procurements; Document No: FTA DC-90-7713-94-1, Rev. B, ","The procurement procedures manual will be expanded to incude detailed procedures for ensuring compliance with pre-award and  post-delivery  requirements.
