Calculation Methodology and Elaboration: Finance does not allocate system-wide revenue to each member city on a monthly basis. Based on the principles of the Cost Allocation Agreement, below is a summary to project September’s Bus, Light Rail, and Ferry passenger fares by city.



1. Ridership and Service Hours By City: a. Service Planning provides ridership and service hours by city.

b. September’s total ridership was 1.6M

i. 1.37m (Bus), 144k (Light Rail) and 26k (Ferry).

c. Total service hours for September was 63k (Bus), 2k (Light Rail) and 0.5k (Ferry) 2. Cash Revenue:

a. Revenue Services provides Cash Revenue by Route using data from GFI.

b. Total Cash Revenue for September was $411k with a ridership of 299k (excludes Paratransit).

i. September’s average cash fare per rider was $1.37.

c. 53 of the 75 fixed routes operate in only one city and therefore all revenue collected on these routes is allocated 100% to the respective city.

d. 22 of the 75 fixed routes and the ferry are shared between two or three cities.

i. Based on service hours by city, shared routes are allocated revenue according to the percentage of hours per city of the shared route.

e. Light Rail includes “Tide 1-Ride and eTickets” revenue of $45k, which is credited 100% to Norfolk and is also included in the $411k Cash Revenue total.



3. Pass Revenue:

b. Total Pass Revenue for September was $895k with a ridership of 1.2m (excludes Paratransit).

i. September’s average revenue per pass usage was $0.74.
